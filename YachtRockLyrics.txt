The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
(If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing
(Who got the power?)
Than nothing at all
 (Oh, now)
What a fool believes
(I believe she's never gone away) he sees
No wise man has the power (to reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be
(Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (better than nothing)
Than nothing at all (oh, I believe)

You ain't crazy
I ain't gonna lie anymore
What you're feelin'
There's a reason for
I wanna do right
Oh, gotta do right
Do I love you, oh
You know I've tried
But what you're after
You can't find in my eyes
I'm gonna do right

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
This is our last chance
To touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

One by one
We're collecting lies
When you can't give love
You give alibis
Now, I'm gonna do right
This time I got to do right
I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna say goodbye
Sooner or later, honey
There comes a time
Mama, when you gotta do right
Come on, come on

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
From this one last chance to
Touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

Why are you so torn apart
I need a little more
Loving in my heart
People say that love will grow
So how was I to know
Love that's come
Through years and years
Can't find a way
Back home anymore

Darlin'
Tell me the truth
Don't turn away
This is our final chance to
Touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
(So darlin' tell me)
Maybe we're near the end
So, darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart
Does anything last forever
I don't know but
But maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So, darling, oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

Everytime you're near
Everytime I see you smile
Hear your "hello"
Saying you can only stay a while

Hey, I know that it's hard for you
To say the things that we both know are true
But tell me how come (I)

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

Everytime I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone too far
And you don't have to tell me why

Why you're gone and why the game is through
If this is what's real, if this is what's true
Tell me how come (I)

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore (Baby)
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear (Yeah)
I keep forgettin'

Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine anymore-anyway-anytime
But tell me how come (I)

I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin' (Every time you're near)
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

There've been times in my life
I've been wondering why
Still, somehow I believed we'd always survive
Now, I'm not so sure you're waiting to hear
One good reason to try
But what more can I say
What's left to provide

You think that maybe it's over
Only if you want it to be
Are you gonna wait for a sign, your miracle?
Stand up and fight

(This is it) Make no mistake where you are
(This is it) Your back's to the corner
(This is it) Don't be a fool anymore
(This is it) The waiting is over

No room to run, no way to hide
No time for wonderin' why
It's here, the moment is now, about to decide
Let him believe
Leave him behind
But keep me near in your heart
Know whatever you do
I'm here by your side

You say that maybe it's over
Not if you don't want it to be
For once in your life
Here's your miracle
Stand up and fight

(This is it) Make no mistake where you are
(This is it) You're goin' no further
(This is it) Until it's over and done

(No one can tell you what you know)
Woah-oh-ho, woah-ahh
(Who makes the choice of how it goes?)
It's not up to me this time
(You know?)
Comes a day in every life

(This is it) Make no mistake where you are
(This is it) You're goin' no further
(This is it) Until it's over and done
(This is it) One way or another
(This is it) No one can tell what the future knows
(This is it) Your back's to the corner
(This is it) You make the choice of how it goes
(This is it) The waiting is over
(This is it) No one can tell what the future knows
(This is it) You're goin' no further
(This is it)
It has begun, there's nothing in the world to stop it now
It's in control, we might as well just try to stop the wind
So give up, give in, you lose
Love will always win, start surrendering
Stop resisting
Nothin' you can do about it, it's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it, relax, enjoy the ride
Destiny...we are what fate intended us to be
Can't you see we're all a part of some eternal plan
So give up, give in, you lose
Love will always win, start surrendering
Stop resisting
Nothin' you can do about it, it's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it, relax, enjoy the ride
Don't you try to understand it, leave it as a mystery
It's bigger than the both of us, we're each other's history
Nothin' you can do about it, it's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it, relax, enjoy the ride
Don't you try to understand it, leave it as a mystery
It's bigger than the both of us, we're each other's history
I've grown tired of fighting
Whether you're right or wrong
Whether I'm weak or strong in your eyes
This is a lonely feeling
Watching you turn away
Why does it have to be this way?
On and on tonight
You've made a point of being right
Making this a game instead of love
You should know where this goes
Someone's heart will surely be broken
Before too long
If we keep on playing this game
Of right or wrong
Who's right and who's wrong
When love is gone?
Who's right or wrong, false or true?
Never used to matter to you
You're almost crying
Saying, "I've gotta run"
Easier said than done, tell me why
I got to know what you're hiding
Turn around and look at me
I've never been this hard to see before
If we'd only come together
For a moment here tonight
You could hold me tight
And ease your troubled mind
You should know where this goes
Someone's heart will surely be broken
Before too long
If we keep on playing this game
Of right or wrong
Who's right and who's wrong
When love is gone?
Who's right or wrong, false or true?
Who's right, who's wrong
When love is gone?
Who's right or wrong, false or true?
Never mattered to you, little girl
Who's right, who's wrong
When love is gone?
Who's right or wrong, false or true?
Right or wrong, lady
Right or wrong, baby
I'm right, you're wrong, lady
You're right, I'm wrong, baby
Right or wrong, lady
Right or wrong, baby
I'm right, you're wrong, lady
You're right, I'm wrong, baby
Right or wrong, lady
Right or wrong, baby
I'm right, you're wrong, lady
You're right, I'm wrong, baby
Right or wrong, lady
Right or wrong, baby
I'm right, you're wrong, lady
You're right, I'm wrong, baby
Talking about who's right or wrong
It never really matters
When your love is gone
Making me shout this right is wrong
If all our loving is gone

All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me
Rosanna
All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be

Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna yeah
Now she's gone and I have to say

Meet you all the way

[Verse 2: Steve Lukather &amp;

I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad
Rosanna
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

[​​​Outro]​

Why?

Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Just tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why? why?), why (why? why? why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em! (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free


Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free
Lying awake, I lay still and I wait
But waiting is all by design
You're asleep by my side and the number I'm dialin'
Is nobody's business but mine
Secrets that I'll never tell
You thought you knew me so well
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
'Cause it's nobody's business but mine
Sometimes I don't know
Should I stay? Should I go?
Is it you or the party unknown?
One way or another, I hope you discover
We're together, but always alone
It's your attention I need
Do you have trouble focusing?
You never notice me
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
'Cause it's nobody's business but mine
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
'Cause it's nobody's business but mine
Nobody's business but mine
It's your attention I need
Do you have trouble focusing?
You never notice me
You never notice
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
'Cause it's nobody's business
Nobody's business but mine
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
Never mind who I'm callin'
'Cause it's nobody's business but mine
(Never mind) You don't know who I'm callin'
(Never mind)
(Never mind) You don't know who I'm callin'

You've got the love
You've got the power
But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour
For your love
I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believin' in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love

I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you'd get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around

Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
Oh, don't you let the lady take it
All away

When the woman needs
A taste of yesterday
And he stays at home
All they get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)

Oh, girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me
We're gonna make it
We're gonna take it
Back where we belong

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)

Turn your love around
(It's time the girl became a woman)
Don't you turn me down
(Every woman needs a man)
I can show you how
(I love the girl, I love the woman)
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
(It's time the girl became a woman)
Don't you turn me down
(Every woman needs a man)
I can show you how
(I love the girl, I love the woman)
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
(It's time the girl became a woman)
Don't you turn me down
(Every woman needs a man)
I can show you how
(I love the girl, I love the woman)

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
And I've got a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Gonna ride like the wind
Ride
Gonna ride like the wind
Gonna ride

Worry the bottle, Mama, it's grapefruit wine
Kick off your 
high-heeled sneakers
, it's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as they play 'til dawn

Nothin' but blues and Elvis
And somebody else's favorite song

Give her some funked-up Muzak
She treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae
She'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right

No static at all
(No static, no static at all)
FM (No static at all)

Give her some funked-up 
Muzak
She treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae
She'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right

No static at all
(No static, no static at all)
FM (No static at all)
I know
I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try
Find a reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, and try it again
Cause it's all right, 
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for me
I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different
And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for love
Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us, the past behind us
Then we're on our way
Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes
You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, you should kick it up
Oooh, and try it again
Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera?
I know they're gonna love it
Peg

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg
, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie

Why don't we make believe we're in love again?
Who said the crimson moon doesn't shine?
Where do people go
When they're lookin' for that one of a kind?
Why don't we make believe that we're sorry?
Why must we hold it all inside?
Where do lovers go when they're runnin'
And there's no place to hide?

(Always rememberin') The day we met in the pouring rain
(No more pretendin') We went our separate ways
No matter which way the wind blows now
Hang on to it anyhow
Don't ever say it could never be the same

Why don't we make believe we're in love again?
Who said the crimson moon doesn't shine?
Where do people go
When they're lookin' for that one of a kind?
Why don't we make believe that we're sorry?
Why must we hold it all inside?
Where do lovers go when they're runnin'
And there's no place to hide?

(Always rememberin') Holding hands on a summer day
(No more pretendin') You took it all away
I didn't come here to change your mind
Lead you on or waste your time
All alone in the evening, gettin' blue

Why don't we make believe?

Why don't we make believe we're in love again?
Who said the crimson moon doesn't shine?
Where do people go
When they're lookin' for that one of a kind?
Why don't we make believe that we're sorry?
Why must we hold it all inside?
Where do lovers go when they're runnin'
And there's no place to hide?

Why don't we make believe?
Why don't we make believe?
Hey, don't worry, I've been lied to
I've been here many times before
Girl, don't you worry, I know where I stand
I don't need this love, I don't need your hand
I know I could turn, blink, and you'd be gone
Then I must be prepared any time to carry on
But minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
You will stay just to watch me, darlin'
Wilt away on lies from you
Can't stop the habit of livin' on the run
I take it all for granted like you're the only one
Livin' on my own
Somehow that sounds nice
You think I'm your fool
Well, you may just be right
'Cause minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
I'll be holding on
Call my name and I'll be gone
You'll reach out and I won't be there
Just my luck you'll realize
You should spend your life with someone
You could spend your life with someone
Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on...
(Bill Champlin Steve Lukather)
Mama thought he had a condition
He barely acted his age
Papa chalked it off to ambition
When he took to the stage
A small town singer doesn't stand a chance
Hiding behind the same old scene
One or two parties and just a few dances
Not enough chances for me
Nobody here can understand
Your favorite son has other plans
Chorus:
Runaway, don't cry again
Kiss goodbye the ties that bind you
Runaway, and try again
Yesterday belongs behind you
Tomorrow takes you home
He tried to stay above the suspicions
But sometimes he gave it away
He knew enough to change his position
The time came to live in L.A
A small town singer just can't get by
Hiding behind the same old scene
Nobody likes to say goodbye
But bye bye, the time has come for me
Nobody here can understand
Your favorite son has other plans
(Chorus)
Runaway
Kiss it all goodbye
Take another try
Tomorrow takes you home
(Chorus)
Someone, someone's done you wrong
You thought that your love was strong
Now you're feeling like such a fool
Poor you
You're thinking maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool, mmm-hmm
Oh, but it's alright (Alright)
Once you get past the pain (Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way, oh
Sometimes we all feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new
Yes, you do
Your dreams feel like they're falling apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid to be true to yourself
Oh, but it's alright (Alright)
Once you get past the pain (Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again (Find your love again)
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way, hey
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Yeah, so now don't, don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through again
Yes, 'cause it's alright (Alright)
Once you get past the pain (Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again (Find your love again)
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way
It's alright (Alright)
Once you get past the pain (Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again (Find your love again)
So keep your heart open
'Cause the love will find a way, oh
Yes, it's alright (Alright)
Don't be afraid 'cause it's alright (Alright)
Oh yes, it's alright (Alright)
Keep your heart open
'Cause the love will find a way
Yes, it's alright (Alright)
Oh, 'cause it's alright (Alright)
Don't be afraid to just open up your heart
That's right, and your love will find a way

This is the day
Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
 (Deacon Blues)

My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)


This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)


It was good for me
It was good for you
Now nothing either of us can say or do
Can change the way you feel tonight
Sometimes love just slips out of sight

Just one thing before you go
Just one thing that you've got to know
No one will ever touch me that way
The way that you did that very first day

And I'll
Never be the same without you here
I'll live alone
Hide myself behind my tears
No I'll
Never be the same without your love
I'll live alone
Try so hard to rise above

The years go by
There's always someone new
To try and help me forget about you
Time and again it does me no good
Love never feels the way that it should

I loved you then I guess I'll love you forever
And even though I know we could never stay together
I think about how it could've been
If we could just start all over again

And I'll
Never be the same without you here
I'll live alone
Hide myself behind my tears
No, I'll
Never be the same without your love
I'll live alone
Try so hard to rise above

It was good for me
It was good for you
Now nothing either of us can say or do
Can change the way you feel today
Sometimes love just slips away

Just one thing before you go
Just one thing that you've got to know
No one will ever touch me that way
The way that you did that very first day

And I'll
Never be the same without you here
I'll live alone
Hide myself behind my tears
Hey...I'll
Never be the same without your love
I'll live alone
Try so hard to rise above

In the corner of my eye
I saw you in Rudy's
You were very high
You were high
It was a cryin' disgrace
They saw your face
On the counter 
by your keys
Was a book of numbers
And your remedies
One of these
Surely will screen out the sorrow
But where are you tomorrow

I can't cry anymore
While you run around
(While you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here

Down to Greene Street
There you go
Lookin' so outrageous
And they tell you so
You should know
How all the pros play the game?
Then you change your name
Like a 
gangster on the run
You will stagger homeward
To your precious one
I'm the one
Who must make everything right
Talk it out till daylight

I don't care anymore
Why you run around
(Why you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here


I can't cry anymore
While you run around
(While you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here

So outrageous
So outrageous
So outrageous

While the music played you worked by candlelight
Those San Francisco nights
You were the best in town
Just by chance you crossed the 
diamond with the pearl
You turned it on the world
That's when you turned the world around

Did you feel like Jesus?
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all
You'd go to L.A. on a dare
And you'd go it alone

Could you live forever?
Could you see the day?
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?

Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne

Now your patrons have all left you in the red
Your low rent friends are dead
This life can be very strange
All those Day-Glo freaks who used to paint the face
They've joined the human race
Some things will never change

Son, you were mistaken
You are obsolete
Look at all the white men on the street

Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne



Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale
Just get it all out of here
Is there gas in the car
Yes, there's gas in the car
I think the people down the hall
Know who you are

Careful what you carry
'Cause the man is wise
You are still an outlaw in their eyes

Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne, (get along)
Get along, Kid Charlemagne

It may seem like the wrong time
To let somebody near
But baby don't fear me
I just want to lend an ear
You can run for cover
Oh, but darling, don't you see
For every smile there's a teardrop
And that's just how it's gonna be
So it went wrong, somewhere down the line
But you can't hold on, it's just a waste of time
Boy you're gonna laugh (just a little bit)
And live through some tears (just a little bit)
Until you finally learn (that the point of it)
Is that love will come again
That's how you start over
That's how you begin again
That's how you start over
Anyone who's lost love
Always seems to swear
To never give your heart away
For someone to share
Listen to your heart, each beat brings you nearer
Till you understand, nothing seems too clear
Boy you're gonna laugh (just a little bit)
And live through some tears (just a little bit)
Until you finally learn (that the point of it)
Is that love will come again
That's how you start over
That's how you begin again
That's how you start over
Love will come again
You don't know my heart that well
Even if I slipped I never fell
I don't need you anymore
I could open up that door
And walk away
I'll bet you think these tears are real
Well, you don't know the way I really feel
And if you think, you broke my heart
Oh, oh, woah...
CHORUS:
Dream on
Dream on (you think I got nobody else)
Dream on
Dream on (make it easy on yourself)
'Cause I won't even say goodbye
And you won't have to tell another lie
I'll throw my suitcase in the car
And drive it just as far
As I can go
I'll be gone when you come in
So you won't have to tell me
Where you've been
And if you think I'm gonna care
Oh, oh, oh...
CHORUS
I'll bet you think these tears are real
Well, you don't know the way I really feel
And if you think, you broke my heart
Oh, oh, woah...
There was a time in your life
When it was easier livin' all alone
Find yourself livin' on the edge
Of another reason why you can't go home
I got news for you
Nothing's lost if what we have is love
Just someone to catch you when you fall
Is the only thing you wanted at all
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Yeah, someone that you can run to
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Don't run away, I'm waitin' to love you
We're just a heartbeat apart
Closer than we've ever been before
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
It's the only thing you wanted at all
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Just someone that you can run to
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Don't run away, I'm waitin' to love you
I'll be there to catch you when you fall
It's the only thing you wanted at all
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Yeah, someone that you can run to
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Don't run away, don't run away
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Don't run away, I'm here for you
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
You need a hero

It was only yesterday that i was down
And the world was looking cold and no may
Had to face alone and almost smashed to ground
A tear was in my eye I just wanted to cry
But you came and said to me: Don’t look so sad
Smile, I can make a whole lot happen
And I realized I needed you stay
It was only yesterday, but I knew right away

Got me breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time i hear you say you care
I’m flying, gliding
High like a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life

It’s a crazy thing you really can’t describe
A moment that will last forever
‘Cause I saw that look of love inside your eyes
My heart just started bumping like the fourth of July
I know I won’t ever be the same again
‘Cause danger’s sitting on my shoulder
It’s a magic feelin’ once you found a friend
‘Cause I know one thing for certain, babe, this love won’t ever end

Got me breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
I’m flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life

Don’t need no money, don’t need no fame
‘Cause love’s fallin’ all around like summer rain
I climb a mountain, cross any sea
As long as I know your sugar's waitin’ for me
Want your love, want your love

Got me breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
I flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life
Breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
I’m flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life
Breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
Flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life
What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played
To be torn and lost in the wilderness
To be lost
And lonely after all
What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved
To feel the warmth of another love
To be lost
And lonely after all
I really don't know anymore
I really can't say
I really don't anymore
I'm just that way
What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played
To keep your heart and have never
Loved
To be lost
And lonely after all
What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved
To give up your heart to another love
To be lost
And lonely after all

Son you better be ready for love
On this glory day
This is your chance to believe
What I've got to say
Keep your eyes on the sky
Put a dollar in the kitty
Don't the moon look pretty

Tonight when I 
chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the 
silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind)

I am holding the mystical sphere
It's direct from Lhasa
Where people are rolling in the snow
Far from the world we know

Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face

Tonight when I 
chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the 
silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind)


Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face

Time out of mind


I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darling, let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day

So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine), ow

And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

Ooh, ooh-ooh

I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
It's never gonna fade

So baby, be mine (Baby you got to be mine), ow
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh-ooh
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh

Won't you stay with me until the morning sun
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
It's living here inside our hearts

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say-

So baby, be mine (Baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)
Ow! (Tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)

Baby be mine (All the time), hoo! (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine, girl

Baby's into runnin' around, hangin' with the crowd
Puttin' your business in the street, talkin' out loud
Sayin' you bought her this and that
And how much you done spent
I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent

Hey, boy
You better bring the chick around
To the sad, sad truth
The dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Taught her how to talk like that
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Gave her that big idea

Nothin' you can't handle, nothin' you ain't got
Put your money on the table and drive it off the lot
Turn on that old lovelight and turn a "Maybe" to a "Yes"
Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess

Hey son
Better get on back to town
Face the sad old truth
The dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Put those ideas in your head
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

Yeah
Come on back down, 
little
 son
Dig the low, low, low, low, lowdown!


You ain't got to be so bad, got to be so cold
This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old
Got to have a jones for this, jones for that
This runnin' with the Joneses, boy, just ain't where it's at, no, no

You gonna come back around
To the sad, sad truth
The dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Got you thinking like that, boy
(Oohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Said I wonder, wonder, wonder, I wonder who
Oh, look out for that lowdown
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
That dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty lowdown
(Ooohooohooohooo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Ooohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Got you thinkin' like that
Got you thinkin' just like that
(Ooohooohooohooo)
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Lookin' that girl in the face is so sad
I'm ashamed of you
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
You work and fight to make your way
It's hard enough alone
You get mad at me for someone else
And you never let it show
When you think that you need no one
You're better off on your own
You're out to lose
You're out to lose
Turn off your heart and walk away
You've been here before and found
If love is all that most men needed
Only slows you down, yeah
When you think that you need no one
You're better off on your own
You're out to lose (You're out to lose, yeah)
You're out to lose (Yeah, you're on your own)
You're out to lose (Yeah, yeah)
You're out to lose
All the love you might have known
Anyone to call your own
Turn off your heart and walk away
You've been here before and found
If love is all that most men needed
It only slows you down, yeah, yeah
When you think that you need no one
You're better off on your own
You're out to lose (You're out to lose, baby)
You're out to lose (You're on your own)
You're out to lose (Oh yeah)
You're out to lose (You're on your own)
You're out to lose (Why do you fight it now?)
You're out to lose
All the love you might have known
Anyone to call your own

Drive west on Sunset to the sea
Turn that jungle music down
Just until we're out of town
This is no one night stand
It's a real occasion
Close your eyes and you'll be there
It's everything they say
The end of a perfect day
Distant lights from across the bay

Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me I'm the only one
Here come those Santa Ana winds again

We'll jog with show folk on the sand
Drink kirschwasser from a shell
San Francisco show and tell
Well I should know by now
That it's just a spasm
Like a Sunday in T.J
That it's cheap but it's not free
That I'm not what I used to be
And that love's not a game for three

Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me I'm the only one
Here come those Santa Ana winds again

My friends say no don't go
For that cotton candy
Son you're playing with fire
The kid will live and learn
As he watches his bridges burn
From the point of no return

Babylon sisters shake it
Babylon sisters shake it
So fine, so young
Tell me I'm the only one


You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it baby
You gotta shake it
I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna treat me like before
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you're always walkin' in and out the door
I don't want you anymore
With all the games that you play, you never let me score
I don't want you anymore
Because you never say just what you're livin' for
(You hurt me) You hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
And loneliness is all I have to keep me company
(You hurt me) You hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye
I don't want you anymore
Don't want you anymore
'Cause you never tell me why I still don't know
I don't want you anymore
Baby, when the well runs dry, there ain't no place to go
Once you do believe that I don't want you anymore
Baby, I'm wonderin'
I'm wonderin' what this whole thing's been for
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time I was walkin' out the door
(You hurt me) Hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
Loneliness is all I have to keep me company
(You hurt me) You hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me, yeah
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye
(It's time to say goodbye)
(Say so long)
Goodbye
(It's time to say goodbye)
(Can't be wrong)
Yeah
I don't want you anymore
Don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna treat me like you did before
It's the same old thing
I don't want you anymore
Anymore, 'cause you're always walkin' in and out the door
I don't want you anymore
Don't want you anymore
With all the games that you play, you never let this poor man score
It's the same old thing
I don't want you anymore
Ah, because you never say what you're livin' for
I don't want you anymore
Girl, I love you, love you, but when I do, you go
It's the same old thing
I don't want you anymore
When you said goodbye
I didn't need to cry
Cause I was not in love with you
Oh but now that we have parted
I just can't get started
I'm just a fool in love with you
I'm a fool in love with you, with youo
Darlin, darlin when a fool has got it
That's when he don't want it
That's a game I played with you
Now that I ain't got it
Girl you know I want it
I'm just a fool in love with you
Fool in love with you
Girls I know that phone me
They all want to own me
What am I supposed to do
Cause when my heart's on fire
Burnin with desire
All I think about is you
I'm a fool in love with you, with youo
Darlin, darlin when a fool has got it
That's when he don't want it
That's a game I played with you
Now that I ain't got it
Girl you know I want it
I'm just a fool in love with you
Fool in love with you

Maybe it's true what they say about
Maybe we can't make the ends meet
Maybe we'll all have to do without
Maybe this world's just incomplete

Well, we all look for truth in this life
Searching with hope inside
If it's so hard living in a desperate world
We all do the best that we can

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
Others will live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I gotta try now
Oh, I've got to try, baby

Maybe it's too much to think about
Maybe there ain't nothin' left to say
But if our time is really runnin' out
Then this ain't no time to run away

'Cause we're destined to look
For the truth in this life
Searching with tearful eyes
If it's so hard livin' in a desperate world
Then tell me why was I born

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
Others will live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I gotta try now

Lonely, living so lonely
It ain't too late
To turn it all around

Some people see a change
Some will 
remain
 the same
Others will live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I've gotta try and change

(Someone's tryin')
Others remain the same
(Someone's cryin' out)
Some of us live our lives under the gun
(While we live under the gun)
Some see the road as clear
(Someone's livin')
Some say the end is here
(Someone's givin' up)
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I gotta try and change
She spins the wheel of fortune on the boardwalk
Where lovers draw their secrets in the sand
Those Coney Island boys in satin jackets
Choose up among themselves
To see who get a chance at those
(Brooklyn girls) They like to talk tough
(Brooklyn girls) They shine in the rough
(Brooklyn girl) Hold on, I'm coming for you
She dreams about the lights across the river
Dances in the dark while the radio plays
She knows that someone out there must be waiting
To take her in his arms
And steal her heart away, oh
(Brooklyn girls) They like to talk tough
(Brooklyn girls) They shine in the rough
(Brooklyn girl) Hold on, I'm coming for you
So much love, lost in a crowd
Take a look around
She's just waiting to be found
(Brooklyn girls) They like to talk tough
(Brooklyn girls) They shine in the rough
(Brooklyn girl) Hold on, I'm coming for you
(Brooklyn girls)
(Brooklyn girls) They like to talk tough guy
(Brooklyn girls) They shine in the rough
(Brooklyn girl) Hold on, I'm coming for you
(Brooklyn girls)
I'm coming for you (Brooklyn girls)
(Brooklyn girls)
(Brooklyn girl)
(Brooklyn girls)
Brooklyn girls, they like to talk tough
Brooklyn girls, they shine in the rough, hey
(Brooklyn girl)
I'm coming for you (Brooklyn girls)
I'm not strong enough
Just to smile and make things easy
I can't put on that brave face anymore
I always took it for granted
That I could take whatever you gave me
I guess you never really know for sure
'Cause there was never a doubt in my mind
How it was meant to be
So who do I turn to darlin' if you should leave me?
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
I've got no excuses for being your fool
I never thought that it would be forever
But after so much time together, I've come to depend on you
What else am I supposed to do?
'Cause there was never a doubt in my mind
It wouldn't be easy
But I never realized how much you mean to me
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
(saxophone solo)
But there was never a doubt in my mind
How it was meant to be
So who do I turn to darlin' if you should leave me?
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
(How Do I Survive)
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
(If you break my heart)
How Do I Survive
(How Do I Survive)
If you break my heart?
(If you break my heart)

When I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully
And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through

He's so shy
He's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy
He's so shy
And he's much too good to let get by
Oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine
He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me

He's so shy (so good lookin')
He's so shy (yes he's really got me goin')
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (I'm so glad I got to know him)
He's so shy ('cause he's a one in a million)
That I'll love him 'til the day I die
Oh yes I will


He's so shy (That's why I love my baby)
He's so shy (You know it's drivin' me crazy)
That sweet little boy who caught my eye (I said)
He's so shy (took a long time to know him)
He's so shy (and I'm so glad I got to show him)
That I'll love him 'til the day I die
Oh yes I will

He's so shy (Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh wee, baby)
He's so shy (Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh wee, baby)
He's so shy
I finally got my life together
Scraped my heart up off the floor
My attitude is so much better
And I hardly ever cry the way I did before
I been livin' it up
Having my self a time
Livin' it up
Right from the women to the wine
I'm living out all those fantasies I never did get to
Those crazy things I never got to do
Got my self a new persona
Put a service on my phone
These days I live the way I wanna
And I do just fine as long as I'm not left alone
I'm livin' it up
Having my self a time
Livin' it up
Right from the women to the wine
I'm living out all those fantasies I never did get to
Those crazy things I never got to do
Every now and then I must confess
I'm not quite up to all this happiness
Sometimes I wonder if the place I'm at is where I do belong
Don't get me wrong
I'm livin' it up
Havin' my self a time
Livin' it up
Right from the women to the wine
I been livin' out all those fantasies I never did get to
But it don't seem like living without you

A thought came in my mind
A feeling so divine
A thought came in my mind
A dream of you and I together

Loving you is fun
And love has just begun to flower
Baby, please don't run
Love me in the sun

My gentle thoughts of you
And all that I've been through, yeah
My thoughts on tryin' it again
Are reborn, but could live or die between us

Loving you is fun
Love has just begun to shower
Baby, please don't run
I will always give my love to you

Only you
Make me see a brighter day
Oh, you, only you
Make me see another way
To fly, only you
I never thought I'd feel this way
For you, only You
Touch my heart and soul and now
I give all my love
To You

A thought came in my mind
A feeling caught in time, ooh yeah
A thought caress to you
A dream that I will always treasure

Dreaming of the day
I will hear you say I love you
Just don't run away
I will always give my love to you

Only you
Make me see a brighter day
Oh you, only you
Make me see another way
To fly, only you
Never thought I'd feel this way
For you, only you
Touch my heart and soul and now I give
You all my love
All my love
Give you all my love

Bada, badababa
Badabadadada, badababada, da, da

You, only you
Make me see a brighter day
Oh you, only you
Make me see another way
Oh you, only you
Make me see a brighter day
Oh you, only you
Make me see another way

Oh you, only you
Make me see a brighter day
Oh you, only you
Make me see another way
Oh you

In the dark
Of the night
Somethin' magic
In the words
That you breathe in my ear
Let the highway unwind
Get me lost
Love me blind

Take me sailing without any sail
Rolling without a rail
Take me traveling on without any trail
Into your heart

There's a spark
In your touch
When we're dancin'
And the stars
In your eyes
Seem to say
I don't care
Where we go
Take me fast
Take me slow

Take me sailing without any sail
Rolling without a rail
Take me traveling on without any trail
Into your heart


I don't care
Where we go
Take me fast
Take me slow

Take me sailing without any sail
Rolling without a rail
Take me traveling on without any trail
Into your heart

Take me sailing
Take me rolling
Take me traveling on, without any trail
Into your heart
Take me sailing
Take me rolling
Take me traveling on, without any trail
Into your heart

We're gonna break out the hats and hooters
When Josie comes home
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters
When Josie comes home to stay
We're gonna park in the street
Sleep on the beach and make it
Throw down the jam till the girls say when
Lay down the law and break it
When Josie comes home

When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire

Jo would you love to scrapple
She'll never say no, no!
Shine up the battle apple
We'll shake 'em all down tonight
We're gonna mix in the street
Strike at the stroke of midnight
Dance on the bones
 till the girls say when
Pick up what's left by daylight
When Josie comes home

When Josie comes home
So bad
She's the best friend we never had
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire



When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire

Heard you caught a falling star
Down on Sunset Boulevard
What a souvenir
It only sparkled for a night
When you held it in the light
The glitter disappeared
Oh, look who's lonely now
Welcome to the other side
Look who's lonely now
You know my arms are open wide
There's a lot of fun uptown
That sophisticated crowd took you for a ride
When they finally let you down
There was no one else around who puts in a plan
Look who's lonely now
Welcome to the other side
Look who's lonely now
You know my arms are open wide
When something isn't right
Then something must be wrong
There's still hope in something missing in my life
And it's good to know
I am not the only one
Look, look who's lonely now
Welcome to the other side
Look who's lonely, lonely now
You know my arms are open wide
Look, look who's lonely now
Welcome to the other side
Look who's lonely now
You know my arms are open wide
When something isn't right
Then something must be wrong
There's still hope in something missing in my life
And it's good to know
I am not the only one...

Margarita, you've been cryin'
I watch your tears waiting inline
It's really not your town
You dream of Mexico
It never was your town
Seems like a lifetime ago
You and your sister
Got torn apart
Strangers and lovers
Broke your heart

I step over the borderline
Margarita will you be mine
Oh you think that love's a game
I step over the borderline
Margarita
Baby will you be mine

You learn how to drink and dance
Walk the streets and take a chance
Nobody knows you
They just call out a name
Nobody loves you
They think love's a game
But I know you
And you broke my heart
It's just bad luck
That keeps us apart

I step over the borderline
Margarita will you be mine
Oh you think that love's a game
I step over the borderline
Margarita
Baby will you be mine

Baby, you broke my heart
If you just think that love's a game
You're tearing me apart


(Baby, you broke my heart)
I step over the borderline
Margarita will you be mine
Oh you think that love's a game
I step over the borderline
Margarita
Baby will you be mine

Way back when, in '67
I was 
a dandy Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I?

Hey Nineteen
No, we can't dance together
(We can’t dance together)
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down

Hey Nineteen
That's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember the Queen of Soul
It's hard times befallen
The sole survivors
She thinks I'm crazy
But I'm just growing old

Hey Nineteen
No, we got nothing in common
(We can’t dance together)
No, we can't talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down

Nice!
Sure looks good!
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Skate a little lower, now

The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
(Say it again)
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing

No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at all
Nothing in this world
Seems to function without tears
You oughta' know
There's no need to pull yourself apart
Nothing you can do
Seems to matter without love
You oughta' know
Everything you've got will be enough
All the things you are
Could stay locked
Up inside
Far from the light of day
It's much more than a matter of pride
Can't you hear them saying
Shine _ aah
Let it be a light that burns within -
Open up and
Shine - aah
Never mind the darkness closing in
You can rise above and
Shine - aah
Just close your eyes and shine
Whatever you may do
Don't forget about the little things
- small as they may seem
They all add up to someone
Else's dreams
Whatever you may think
No- one wants to show you the way
- you can be the one
There's no better time to call the play
All the things you do
Will stay with you wherever you go
- no use in trying to hide
It's much more than a matter of show
All you've got to do is
Shine, etc

Now you're next to me, my love
That's where you should be, my love
This is fantasy to me

Something called love made me want to find out
Did not think you could ever care
But I'm outta control

Come on and hold me
Just like you told me
Then show me
What I want to know

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Don't tease me
Why don't you please me
And show me
What you came here for

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Into the night, babe
Baby, tonight
Ooh

I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after
No second chances tonight
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away

Into the night
I know it ain't right
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right
Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away
Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away
I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna treat me like before
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you're always walkin' in and out the door
I don't want you anymore
With all the games you play, you never let me score
I don't want you anymore
Because you never say just what you're livin' for
(You hurt me) Hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
And loneliness is all I have to keep me company
(You hurt me) Ooh, you hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye
I don't want you anymore
'Cause you never tell me why I still don't know
I don't want you anymore
Baby, when the well runs dry, there ain't no place to go
I don't want you anymore
Baby, I said I'm wonderin'
I'm wonderin' what this whole thing's been for
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time I was walkin' out the door
(You hurt me) Ooh, you hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
And loneliness is all I have to keep me company
(You hurt me) Ooh, you hurt me
(Desert me) Desert me
If freedom comes from happiness
It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye
Yeah
I don't want you anymore
I'm afraid you're gonna treat me like before
I don't want you anymore
Pack your bags, get your ass, come on, get on out the door
I don't want you anymore
Mama, it's high time you were walking out the door
I don't want you anymore
Pack your bags, get your ass, come on, get on out the door
I don't want you anymore
Just be gone, don't take long, come on
You better find a place to go
I don't want you anymore
Hey mama, I'm gettin' moody
Shake your booty
I don't want you anymore

Businessman, green sedan
Sold his soul to reach his goal
Working his way up the ladder
Success is the ends and his lies are the means
Business cards, big cigars
Smiles conceal a rotten deal
Money can talk and he knows it
One piece of paper can make you or break you apart
Oh – It's a rat race, Mr. Briefcase
Can you keep pace, Mr. Briefcase?
What do you keep in that bag of tricks?
Is there anything at all in that briefcase?
If I sign my name must I play the game?
A deal's a deal when it's signed and sealed
No time to feel sorry for losers
A cat gets the mouse and the dog eats the dog – Oh
Oh – It's a rat race, Mr. Briefcase
Can you keep pace, Mr. Briefcase?
What do you keep in that bag of tricks?
Is there anything at all in that briefcase?
Businessman, shake my hand
Tell me lies, but hide your eyes
Hang on real tight to your briefcase
If you should lose it, you'll have to stand naked like me
It's a rat race, Mr. Briefcase
Can you keep pace, Mr. Briefcase?
What do you keep in that bag of tricks?
Is there anything at all?
Oh – It's a rat race, Mr. Briefcase
Can you keep pace, Mr. Briefcase?
What do you keep in that bag of tricks?
Is there anything at all?
Is there anything at all?
Is there anything at all in that briefcase?

Ten miles east of the highway
Hot sparks burnin' the night away
Two lips touchin' together
Cheek to cheek, sweatshirt to sweater
Young love, born in a back seat
Two hearts pound out a backbeat
Headlights, somebody's comin'
Got to move, keep on a runnin'
With the hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite
Schoolgirl brushes her hair back
Blue jeans can't hide the bare facts
Bad boy knows where to find her
Runs the light, sneaks up behind her
Hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite
True believers livin' on the borderline
They're just dreamers killin' time
(They're just killin' time)
Killin' time
(They're just killin' time)
Killin' time
(Out on the borderline)
Times are hard for those hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
(Here come)
Here com the hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite
Girl with the hot rod heart tonight
Girl with the hot rod heart tonight
(Keep runnin')
With the hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight

You were such a prophet back in '63
You had all the answers
You became the first to set the children free
But nothing lasts forever, does it
Time goes on and dreams, they wash away

You traded in your karma for the 70's
Searching for a meaning
You rented out your land up in Monterey
Livin' for the city
Disco nights, you'd swing, and wonder why
[Chorus] (2x)
O.C.O.E. - you got charisma
O.C.O.E. - you fit the picture
Somewhere in the netherworld of cons and scams
Lives a lost messiah
Rushin' to the future and runnin' from the past
Intent on getting higher
So knocked out, so real, a hopeless jag
[Chorus] (2x)

So knocked out, so real, a hopeless jag
[Chorus] (2x)
Maybe it's true what they say about it
Maybe we can't make the ends meet
Maybe we'll all have to do without it
Maybe this world's just incomplete
Still we all look for truth in our lives
Searching from different sides
If it's so hard living in a desperate world
But we all do the best that we can
Some people dream a change
Some will remain the same
All of us live their lives
Under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say, I gotta try
Maybe there's too much to think about
Maybe there just ain't nothing left to say
But if our time's really running out
Then this is no time to run away
'Cause we're destined to look for truth in this life
Blinded by tearful eyes
If it's no use trying in a desperate world
Then tell me, why was I born?
Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
All of us live their lives
Under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say, I gotta try
Lonely, living so lonely
Is it too late
To turn it all around?
Some people dream a change
Some will remain the same
All of us live their lives
Under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say, I gotta try
I gotta change
The world just remains the same
All of us live our lives
Under the gun
Someone's sleeping
Someone's giving up
Someone's trying
Someone's crying out
Still we live under the gun

I don't know what you do to me
But this feeling is here to be
I hope it's love and one day we'll see the moon
Take my hand and we'll fly away
A love so new 'til the dying day
A life so true all you have to say is you will

You've got to believe in something
You've got to believe in
Give it up
Give it up
My love is true now
Say me and you now
Give it up
Give it up

Just say the word and I'm screaming out your name
So make it true, to make it us
Just give me half a chance
I need your love
Hope it's me you're thinkin' of
A love to give, I can't live
Just give me half the chance

I don't know what you do to me
But this feeling is here to be
Just say that you'll be giving me your love
All you got to do is
Give it up, give it up, ooh
Give it up, give it up, ah
Give it up, give it up, ooh
Give it up, give it up

You've got to believe in something
You've got to believe me
Give it up
Give it up
My love is true now
Say me and you now
Give it up
Give it up

Just say the word and I'm screaming out your name
So make it true, to make it us
Just give me half a chance
I need your love
Hope it's me you're thinkin' of
A love to give, I can't live
Just give me half the chance

I don't know what you do to me
But this feeling is here to be
Just say that you'll be giving me your love

All you got to do is
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
You got that look in your eyes
Something deep inside
And time will show
What you don't want to know
It's haunting you
Guess it's time to sit down with the truth
And though it comes as no surprise
Some things are not better left unsaid
Let them out instead
I'm haunting you
Guess it's time to sit down with the truth
Got to get acquainted with the truth
Oh and it was here
This place that we hide away in
If it's gone now
It's best that a new place begin
We shared in the fantasy of
Knowing this love in our lives
Is it ever what it seems to be
Oh and if it's over
Let me go, love
Let me go, love
Woke up here, in the desert
Wondering where'd everybody go
Last thing I remember
Is going through hills of snow
Lots of palms in your arms
I went so high I went so low
You could be my oasis
But you're gonna have to go slow
And take it as a warnin'

(Baby, don't push me) Don't push me
One step over the borderline
(I know...) Anything can happen
If you push this old heart of mine
Over the borderline
I've been used and abused
Nobody does it quite like you
Though the pain keeps me sane
I got nothing better to do
Call it love, call it lazy
Just get me through another day
(Tell me lies) Tell me lies, I'm so crazy
I believe whatever you say
Take it as a warnin'

(Baby, don't push me) Don't push me
One step over the borderline
(I know...) Anything can happen
If you push this old heart of mine
Over the borderline
It's over, it's over
I went through you, you went through me
It's over, I'm sober
But will you ever think of me

(Baby, don't push me) Don't push me
One step over the borderline
(I know...) Anything can happen
If you push this old heart of mine
(Baby, don't push me) Don't you push me
One step (over the borderline)
Over the borderline (I know...)
Over the borderline
(If you push this old heart of mine)
(Baby) Baby
(Don't push me) Don't push me
(One step over the borderline)
Over the borderline (I know...)
Anything can happen
If you push this old heart of mine
(Baby don't push me)
(One step over the borderline)
(I know...) Anything can happen, babe
If you push this old heart of mine
Baby (don't push me)
(One step over the borderline)
(Ne me regarde pas)
(Je reconnais cet air là)
(Encore un éclat de larmes dans tes yeux)
(Je n'en sais pas la raison)
(Je n'ai pas de solution)
(Tu m'imposes tes humeurs, tes menteux)
Alors qu'avant, ce regard là m'inquiétait vraiment
Aujourd'hui, ils m'inspirent la pitié
Ce qui passe dans l'orgueil d'un grand homme
Quand l'amour et son absurdité lui crèvent les yeux
(Ne me regarde pas)
(Je reconnais cet air là)
(Encore un éclat de larmes dans tes yeux)
T'es-tu vu les yeux?
(Je n'en sais pas la raison)
(Je n'ai pas de solution)
(Tu m'imposes tes humeurs, tes menteux)
Je veux revoir les mêmes yeux qui, dans ma mémoire
Ont séduit bien des filles avant moi
Et à peine ont brillé presque juste pour moi
Je veux rire aux larmes et en voir l'éclat dans tes yeux
(Ne me regarde pas)
(Je reconnais cet air là)
(Encore un éclat de larmes dans tes yeux)
As-tu vu tes yeux?
(Je n'en sais pas la raison)
(Je n'ai pas de solution)
(Tu m'imposes tes humeurs, tes menteux)
(Ne me regarde pas)
(Je reconnais cet air là)
(Encore un éclat de larmes dans tes yeux)
(Je n'en sais pas la raison)
(Je n'ai pas de solution)
(Tu m'imposes tes humeurs, tes menteux)
(Ne me regarde pas)
(Je reconnais cet air là)
(Encore un éclat de larmes dans tes yeux)
(Je n'en sais pas la raison)
(Je n'ai pas de solution)...

I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun
When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only let me try
You touch me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready
To kiss that dream goodbye
When it's this sweet, there's no saying no
I need you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

Through the test of time

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

To the wire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever

I can't stand this feeling
When you turn and look my way
And make my day
And look away for someone better
And if I could I'd show you how
It feels to be insane
I'd break your heart
And put it back together - I would

Love you out of your mind
Love you out of your mind
I would take you up to the top
And make you start all over
Love you out of your mind
Drive you down on that fine line
And never stop until I love you
Out of your mind

You stand to leave
But I know you can't stand to leave alone
Look me in the eye
And tell me you don't want me
Let me hold your hand
And twist your arm and take you home
And I will show you just what happens
When you taunt me

Love you out of your mind
Love you out of your mind
I would take you up to the top
And make you start all over
Love you out of your mind
Drive you down on that fine line
And never stop until I love you
Out of your mind

I'd break your heart
And put it back together - I would

Love you out of your mind
Love you out of your mind
I would take you up to the top
And make you start all over
Love you out of your mind
Drive you down on that fine line
And never stop until I love you
Out of your mind

From the beginning
You were my life
And through the seasons
I made the sacrifice
Now I remember
What you did to me before
It keeps bringing me down
And the relation
Tore me apart
You were so clever
Girl it broke my heart
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
It keeps spinning around

Darling somehow
Now that you're gone
I have no one
I write you letters
And throw them away
Only a fool keeps hanging on
When love slips away

Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on
Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Tell me where I went wrong

Through all the changes
Love was so blind
But I continued
Keeping an open mind
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
I keep spinning around

Darling somehow
Now that you're gone
I have no one
I write you letters
And throw them away
Only a fool keeps hanging on
When love slips away


Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on
Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

If you're askin' me to say
Livin' life without you, girl, is alright
If you really want to know
I'd have to say it's dangerous to my mind

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Let me love you all the time
Lady, love me

Yes, I'm askin' you to stay
Remembering it used to be so right
If you're askin' for the truth
I'd have to say I won't believe it's goodnight

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Lady, love me


So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Love me, lady, all the time
Let me love you one more time
Hold me closer, now you're mine
Lady, love me one last time
Lady, love me
Oh, love me, lady

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me one last time
Lady, love me (Love me, lady, all the time)
Let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Lady, love me (Love me, lady, now you're mine)
Let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Lady, love me all the time
Look what you've done for me-
You're makin' more fun for me
Troubadour me,
 destined to be
Set in my ways-stuck in my daze
You were the butterfly
Winkin' at me-
Makin' my fires fly
Brought me romance
Taught me to dance-
Makin' me win, makin' me grin
Schoolin' me

Breakin' away, your love has
Opened eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away, your beacon in the
The night discovered me
Show me some parachutes
(Away, today, sail away)
As long as I'm here, bring me some
Climbing boots
Open the door, give me some more
Fasten me in-loosen the pin
Pull for me

Breakin' away, your love has opened
Eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away, your beacon in the
Night discovered me
Chorus:
I can be what I want to
And all I need is to
Get my boogie down
I can be what I want to
You know all I need is to
Get my boogie down
You can be what I want to
And all I need is to
Get my boogie down
I got my certain and my sure 'nough on
And I'm puttin' on my really for real
You face that curtain with your best stuff on
You are the winner and you're gonna feel
You can be what you want to
And all you need is to
Get your boogie down
Chorus
I got my certain and my sure 'nough on

Get your boogie down
You can be what you want to
And all you need is to
Get your boogie down
Now you go one and two and three
Here's a little step for you and me
Come and strut your stuff but leave enough
For the nearest boogie and truest boogie woogie
Chorus
We could make it happen
If we try a little harder
I could tell by lookin
There was love in your heart
I could stay forever with you
Right here where we started
In this side of heaven
That I found here in your arms
'Cause you make me feel like someone new
You make me feel so good
You make me realize what your love could do
I'm happy that love has found you
Let it flow as the river runs wild
I'm happy that love has found you
Now I know this love will never run dry
You keep setting fire
To the soul that burns inside me
I won't let you go until I fill you with its light
We can make it happen if we try a little harder
I could tell by lookin there was love in your heart

'Cause you make me feel so wonderful
You make me feel brand new
You made my hopeless dreaming come true

You don't know me but I'm your brother
I was raised here in this living hell
You don't know my kind in your world
Fairly soon, the time will tell

Oh, you, telling me the things
You're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like
What I think I see

(Taking it to the streets)
Taking it to the streets
(Taking it to the streets)
No more need for running
(Taking it to the streets)

Take this message to my brother
You will find him everywhere
Wherever people live together
Tied in poverty's despair

Oh, you, telling me the things
You're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like
What I think I see

(Taking it to the streets)
Taking it to the streets
(Taking it to the streets)
No more need for running
(Taking it to the streets)
Taking it to the streets
(Taking it to the)


Oh, you, telling me the things
You're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like
What I think I see

No more need for running

Yeah, yeah
(Taking it to the streets)
Taking it to the streets

Before it steps farther
(Taking it to the streets)
Oh, lord
(Taking it to the streets)
Taking it, taking it
(Taking it to the streets)
Hey, yeah ha

Taking it to the streets

The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

You were looking so good girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning
We were going to go all the way and we never had a doubt

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

Just you and I, girl it was so right (We were running)
Girl so right (running with the night)
So right

6:05, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good
He's a crowd pleasing man

One on one
He's schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard
He's Jungle Jim, again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car

We're a star
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys

All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel
With his Eurasian bride

On the town
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers
Is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness
While they danced

I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
(I'm the one)
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys


Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
That's my claim to fame

Jive Miguel
He's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight
At Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done

I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
(I'm the one)
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys


I see you in a lonely place
How can you be so blind
You're still regretting
The love you left, left behind
Oh darling
I've seen you go through the changes
Sitting alone each night
Are you expecting to find the love
Love that's right

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you'll never find a love that's right
Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
Girl you think you're so wise
You're so wise

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
I take my chances
Before they pass, pass me by
Oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You need a look at the other side
You'll agree

Darling open your eyes
Let me show you the light
You may never find a love that's right

Oh babe
Ooh-hoo

Tell me why is it you tease me
When you know it hurts so bad?
Now you want to come around and see me
It must feel good to make me sad
We've been through this so many times before
Ooh baby
It's more than I can take
You know I couldn't go through this any more

So leave me alone tonight
All right
Leave me alone tonight
You've got the rest of your life
Leave me alone tonight
And let me go my own way
Hear me when I say
Leave me alone tonight

Well I know I'll get by without you
For there was nothing left to do
'cause all you ever did was use me
It's been this way too long
And I just can't go on, so
Let it be just the way it is
Ooh baby
Try to understand
I just don't give a damn any more

So leave me alone tonight
All right
Leave me alone tonight
You've got the rest of your life
Leave me alone tonight
And let me go own way
Hear me when I say...


Leave me alone tonight
All right
Leave me alone tonight
You've got the rest of your life
Yeah
And let me go my own way
Hear me when I say
Leave me alone tonight

Leave me alone tonight
Leave me alone tonight
Leave me alone tonight
Leave me alone tonight
All by myself
Leave me alone tonight
All alone
Leave me alone tonight
Yeah yeah
Leave me alone tonight
From the album THE LONGEST ROAD (1980)
If and any day I love you, father. You will be the one I believe in longer
I can only try to understand you. You can only smile and understand me
Tell me how did I lose my way? Isn't there a door that leads to yesterday?
Oh how did I lose my way? Isn't there a door that opens into another day?
If and any time I see the sorrow. I will spend the longest time 'til I go under. 
Love is for the ones who believe in one on one. Truth is for the ones who believe there's more to come
Tell me how did I lose my way? Isn't there a door that leads to yesterday?
Oh how did I lose my way? Isn't there a door that opens into another day?
Tell me how did I lose my way? Isn't there a door that leads to yesterday?
Oh how did I lose my way? Isn't there a door that opens into another day?
Caught up in the middle, I never thought you'd capture my love
Caught up in the middle and I'm falling so fast
Came little by little, now it's much too hard to resist
Caught up in the middle of the way you made me love you
I can't imagine how it could be true
There's a magic, there's a magic keeps me running back to you
Like a blind man seeing something that he never knew
I get caught up, caught up in the middle of your love, your love
Caught up in the middle, you made me lose control of myself
Caught up in the middle and I can't get free now
Came little by little, so slow but it hit me so fast
Caught up in the middle of the way you made me love you
I can't imagine how I could refuse
There's a magic, there's a magic keeps me running back to you
Like a blind man seeing something that he never knew
I get caught up, caught up in the middle of your love
That I need you, I can't imagine how it could be true
There's a magic, whoo, there's a magic keeps me running back to you
Like a blind man seeing something that he never knew
I get caught up, caught up in the middle of your love, your love

Hands, don't let her go
Cause then the midnight icy winds will blow
Eyes, give every drop
This ain't the way that should have made her stop
Arms, just let her know
No one fills the place she used to grow
Smile, don't leave me now
Cause you're the reason she's here anyhow

Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been waitin' for your love
And it's been here all the time, right in front of me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me

Look, forget your pride
She might kiss as you're like even tide
So, be in her heart
Especially when we're apart
Love, be by my side
Cause if she leaves there ain't no place to hide
Soul, be with her now
Cause you're the first one she knew anyhow

Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been waitin' for your love
And it's been here, all the time, right in front of me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me


Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me
Draw the line, I'll step across
Even further, I give in, you got me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me, yeah
Just separated by ten thousand miles
You're not alone, girl, you got me
Guess I needn't tell you, child, I'm not around
I'm inside, you got me
I've been waitin' for your love
It's been here, all the time, right in front of me, yeah
Say, where you gonna go?
Girl, where you gonna hide?
You go on leavin' out your heart
And all it's sayin' down deep inside
From here I can feel your heartbeat
Oh, you got me all wrong
You ain't got no worry
You just been lonely too long
I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago
Oh, darlin'
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps you runnin')
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps you runnin')
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (Well)
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'
Oh, I know how you feel
Hey, you know I been there
But what you're keepin' to yourself
Oh, you know it just ain't fair
Are you gonna worry
For the rest of your life?
Why you in such a hurry
To be lonely one more night?
Well, I know what it means to hide your heart
From a long time ago
Oh, darlin'
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps you runnin', hey, yeah)
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (I know it does, baby)
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'
It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin' (It keeps your runnin')
Where are you now?
Are you far away from me?
Well, I just don't know how
I let you go so easily
And it feels like I'm falling one more time
'Cause I can't seem to get you off my mind
Darling
Please keep a light on for me
'Cause tonight I can't see
Another place that I'd rather be
Please keep a light on for me
'Cause tonight I can't see
Another place that I'd rather be
Was it there in my head
I don't know what's left to say
Well, I can't understand
How I let you slip away
And it feels like I'm losing my best friend
Still, I know I'll find you again
Darling
Please keep a light on for me
'Cause tonight I can't see
Another place that I'd rather be
Please keep a light on for me
'Cause tonight I can't see
Another place that I'd rather be
Whoa, please
Keep a light on for me
'Cause tonight I can't see
Another place that I'd rather be
Please keep a light on for me, yeah
'Cause tonight I can't see
Another place that I'd rather be
Honey, I'll always love you
I promise to always love you
Cause I think the whole world of you
And you can't change that, no, no
There's nothing you can do or say
I thought about this for many a day
And my mind's made up to feel this way
And you can't change that
'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that
You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that
Now you can try
If you want to, woo
You can change your telephone number
And you can change your address too
But you can't stop me from loving you
No, you can't change that, no, no
You can change the color of your hair
And you can change the clothes you wear
But you'll never change the way I care
No, you can't change that
'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You're the one I love)
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that
You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that
You're the one I love, girl
And you can try if you want to
Try me, baby, woo
No, you can't change that
You're the one I love
You can try but you
Can't change that
You're the one
Now you can change your telephone number
And you can change your address too
But you can't stop me from loving you
No, you can't change that
'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You're the one I love)
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that
(I need you, baby)
You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You may change a dollar bill)
You're the only one I need
(But let me tell you one thing)
And you can't change that
(You won't change the way I feel)
(You're the only one I love)
(And you can't change that)
I say my heart tells me how I feel
(You're the only one I need)
(And you can't change that)
It lets me know
It lets me know my love is real
(You're the only one I love)
No, you can't change that
You can't change my love girl
You're the only one I love
I need you, I love
I love, I need you
Easy
To fill a lonely night
So easy
So hard to find the one
You tease me
When I'm in love with you
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Take a lonely man to Paradise
In my eyes
You will see
The love you're lookin' for
Lonely
Will only be a memory
Won't you show me
The love you hide away
When you know me better
You'll never forget my love
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Take a lonely man to Paradise
In my eyes
You will see
The love, all that you need
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Let me take you all the way
To Paradise, baby
Take me to Paradise
Paradise, baby
I'll take you to Paradise
You're knowing
And not believing in what I'm showing
When this new romance between us
Can be growing, baby
Just fall in love with me
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Take a lonely man to Paradise
In my eyes, you will see
The love, all that you need
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
Let me take you all the way
To Paradise, baby
Take me to Paradise
Paradise, baby
I'll take you to Paradise
Paradise, baby
Take me to Paradise
Paradise, baby
I'll take you to Paradise
Paradise, baby
Take me to Paradise
Paradise, baby
I'll take you to Paradise
Someone's just outside, knocking at my door
A stranger, somebody unknown
Someone's in my dreams, can't get it off my mind, yeah
I'm tired of being alone
Someone's trying to find an easy way inside
Come on, I'm right here at home, right at home
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you, you, you?
Who's that deep inside me, sneaking around my heart?
Are you somebody in love?
Show me what you're doing and tell me who you are
Hey, I'm ready for love, for love
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you?
Is it you, you, you?
If it's you, come out in the open
You don't need to hide your love
If it's you, you know I'm hoping
'Cause it's way too late to run away
Don't run away from love, my love
Is it you?
Is it you, knocking at my door?
Is it my imagination?
Is it you, I can't get off my mind?
Is it you, you, you?
Is it you, sneaking around my heart?
Is it my imagination?
Is it you, I can`t get off my mind?
You, you, you?

Ever since the day we met
I knew that I would not regret
I could never leave you for another
But you treat me like a fool
I can't keep on being cool
Now I need some time just to recover
With a ticket to a distant place
I could leave you far behind
Your love has put me into outer space
I'm about to lose my mind
There are things about you
I will never understand
And although our love
Is not exactly what I planned
Ooh, It was meant to be
Darling can't you see

You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you

Maybe it would be worthwhile
If I could make you change your style
But honey you would never have that notion
You would have to rearrange
The things that you would never change
Tell me why you play with my emotions

If you see confusion on my face
Well, it's just my state of mind

Ooh, ooh

You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
Oh, no
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I lie
I will love you (oh, baby)
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you

Your love has put me into outer space
I'm about to lose my mind
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
I will love you
You and I just can't say goodbye
Till the day I die
No more running down the wrong road
Dancing to a different drum
Can`t you see what`s going on
Deep inside your heart?
Always searching for the real thing
Living like it's far away
Just leave all the madness in yesterday
You're holding the key when you believe it
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Smiling with the rising sun
Living like we've never known
Going all the way
Reaching out to meet the changes
Touching every shining star
The light of tomorrow
It's right where we are
There's no turning back from what I'm feeling
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on
Cause they'll be starlight all night
When it comes together
Share those feelings
Dancing in your eyes
Tonight they're guiding us
Shining til the morning light
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic, magic, baby
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit
Alive, on and on
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
Shine, sweet freedom
Carry me along
Shine your light on me
We'll keep the spirit
Alive, on and on
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You are the magic, babe

They say love is blinding
Maybe that's why it always believes you
And you need reminding
You said it was you and me
You told me a story
Just to get me to think you were all mine
While you just ignore me
I'm standing here alone

Promises, promises
I've been receiving
Tell me that you'll always stay
Promises, promises
Keep me believing
In something that's gone away

Put your cards on the table
'Cause I think that I know what you're doing
You're finally unable
To tell another liе


Promises, promises
Tendеrly spoken
That love was just a masquerade
Promises, promises
Were made to be broken
You broke every one you made
Hey


Promises, promises
I've been receiving
Tell me that you'll always stay
Promises, promises
Keep me believing
In something that's gone away

Promises, promises
I've been receiving
Tell me that you'll always stay
Promises, promises
Keep me believing
In something that's gone away

Promises, promises
I've been receiving
Tell me that you'll always stay
Promises, promises
Keep me believing
In something that's gone away

You, 
in your Lark
You're a mark
You're a screamer
You know how to hustle
Daddy is a rare millionaire
I don't care
Yeah, you got the muscle
I got the news

Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow

Take it in your hand
All the 
sirens
 and the band
Get to bendin' my ear
How was I to know
About the warm
Soulful secret
You been keepin' for years
I got the news

Slow down I'll tell you when
I may never walk again

Broadway Duchess
Darling if you only knew
Half as much as
Everybody thinks you do
What I hear may be true
I would still be proud
To know you



Spanish kissin'
See it glisten
You came ragin'
Love rampagin'

I got the news
Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow

Something has come over you
And it makes me wonder oh
Girl what am I gonna do
When you buy a one way ticket to paradise
Leave your love behind
I’ll be all by myself
The day that you go
I’ll be in love with somebody else
While you’re closing the show
Every time a story ends
Somebody win or loses
We’ll only be the best of friends
Because you bought a one way ticket to paradise
Where I’ll be off your mind
Girl you got a one way ticket to paradise
Who’ll be left behind
I’ll be all by myself
The day that you go
I’ll be in love with somebody else
While you’re closing the show
I’ll be all by myself
The day you go
I’ll be in love with somebody else
While you’re closing the show
I’ll be all by myself
The day that you go
I’ll be in love with somebody else
While you’re closing the show
I’ll be all by myself
The day that you go
I’ll be in love with somebody else
While you’re closing the show
I’ll be all by myself
The day that you go
I’ll be in love with somebody else
While you’re closing the show
Ooh, ooh, ooh, it's something
You and I have something
How I long to be around when
When you can see that
You and I have something
Come on, oh, oh, it's something
You better believe it
And I'm sure of one thing
How I long to be around when
When you can see that
You and I have something
And come on, it's been a revelation, yeah
You've been an inspiration to me
And there is not one question, no
And my heart will run to you
Oh, oh, it's something
You better believe it
You and I have something
I don't wanna lose this time, babe
And hope you can see that
'Cause you and I have something
In my heart I can't believe we've been so blind
Looks like we've wasted so much time
There's not a doubt that rings untrue
Said when I'm with you
Oh, you and I got something
Come on, oh, oh, it's something
Oh, you and I, we got something
Come on, oh, oh, it's something
I get the feeling that I'm in way over my head
I should be careful but I'm goin deeper instead
Cause when she looks at me
I wanna run by her side
Anyone could see
A fool could drown in her eyes
And I'm goin down for the last time
I'm goin down for the last time
Goin down, out of my mind
I'm nearly out of my mind
Love is comin over, over me
It must be magic how she casts her spell over me
Her secret passions got me charmed
I'll never get free
Cause when she's holding me
She lights a fire in my soul
Any fool could see
There's only one place to go
[Verse 1: Michael McDonald, 
Doobie Brothers
Girl, as we take a long last look at this love
Before you go, baby, I've got to know
I've got to know, was it ever true
Was it ever true, baby?
I've got to hear it from you
Girl, I can take one more hurt in this heart
Before you go, baby, I've got to know
I've got to know, was it ever true
Was it ever true, baby?
I've got to hear it from you
Not like before
We were lost in a whirling dance
Never slowing down
Long enough to give truth a chance
To come out
So that the light could shine in
[Chorus: Doobie Brothers, 
Michael McDonald
Open your eyes (
Open your eyes, baby
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown (
Oh baby
Open your eyes (
Open your eyes, darling
Let's not let what never was bring us down

[Verse 2: Michael McDonald, 
Doobie Brothers
I've got to know
I've got to know, was it ever true
Was it ever true, baby?
I've got to hear it from you
Not like before
We were lost in a whirling dance
Never slowing down
Long enough to give truth a chance
To come out
So that the light could shine in
[Outro: Michael McDonald, 
Doobie Brothers
Open your eyes (
Open your eyes now, baby
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown (
Oh baby
Open your eyes (
Open your eyes now
Let's not let what never was bring us down (
Open your eyes, baby
Open your eyes (
Yeah, yeah
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown (
Yeah, yeah
Open your eyes
Let's not let what never was bring us down

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
 m-m-m

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
[Verse 3: Michael + 
Paul
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one's town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
[Verse 4: Michael + 
Paul
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
[Refrain: Michael + 
Paul
She's mine,
 she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, 
the girl is mine
The girl is mine, 
the girl is mine
The girl is mine
 (mine, mine); 
yep, she's mine
 (mine, mine)
The girl is mine
 (mine, mine); 
yeah, she's mine
 (mine, mine)

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
[Interlude: Michael + 
Paul
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming
[Outro: Michael + 
(Paul)
(I don't believe it!) (Mine, mine)
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, mine)
 No, mine (Mine, mine)
(She's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine)
 (Mine, mine, mine)
'Cause the girl is mine
(No, the girl is mine)
 (Mine, mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, 
the girl is mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine)
(No, she's mine)
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Heard today you've gone back with him
What goes around comes back again
Heavy words take a greater fall
When there's no love to back it all
Have we been building upon a crumbling bed
How could I forget those words you said
If your love made me blind, I'll get back in line
Don't give up on us
I don't want to lose you
Don't give up on us
Don't give up on us
I don't want to lose you
Don't give up on us
Whatever happened to the perfect team
It's always been just you and me
Breaking up is such an awful crime
But we can save it in the nick of time
Take heart, we've made it this far
I know it's been tough
But if you're falling, hold on to my love
I'm willing to bend until you give in
Don't give up on us
I don't want to lose you
Don't give up on us
Don't give up on us
I don't want to lose you
Don't give up on us
Have we been building upon a crumbling bed
How could I forget those words you said
If your love made me blind, I'll get back in line
Don't give up on us
I don't want to lose you
Don't give up on us
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Look at what you're doing
Look at what you're doing to me
Don't give up, don't give up on us
(Oh-whoa-whoa...)
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Think about it, baby
Don't you throw love away
Don't give up, don't give up on us
(Don't throw love away)
Don't give up, don't give up on us
You've made it this far
So, baby, don't you throw it away
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Look at what you're doing
Look at what you're doing to me
Don't give up, don't give up on us
(Don't give up on us, girl)
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Think about it, baby
Don't you throw love away
Don't give up, don't give up on us
Don't give up, don't give up on us...
Darling, let's stop this pretending
What more is there to say?
Here's to your eyes and my final demise
Oh, Simone, it's you
I knew from the start that my easily-touched heart
Was about to go out for a ride
Conquer the room with a touch of perfume
Oh, Simone, it's you
Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right
Make it romantic, make it up I don't care
Look up and sigh even if it's a lie
Oh, Simone, what can I do?
What charm could sway me
Then burn and betray me
But thrill me the way that you do
Second to none, so completely undone
Oh, Simone, it's you
Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right
It's time they told you, it's about time you knew
Straighten your gown throw a Manhattan down
Yes, Simone, it's true
What do you think, you're foolin' somebody
Do you think that I can't see?
There's no doubt, not a trace
It's all over your face
Oh, Simone, it's me, ooh
Oh, Simone, my heart is breakin'
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Gotta let me know
Gotta let it show, for it to last
Oh, Simone, to hold you
Dance you into the night
And on into the dawn
And on and on and on to make it right, oh
Yes, my dear, I think it's goin' fast
Whatcha gonna do with my time darlin'
Whatcha gonna do with my soul
When you gonna make up your mind about me
What you still need to know
When you gonna walk out the door forever
Where you gonna run and hide
Darlin' can't you see that it's now or never
Say you're gonna stay or say goodbye, but....
Let's get on with it
Let's get started
Climb up or fall down the hill
Either forward or
Else it's backward but
Nothin' ever stands still
So let's get on with it
Whatcha gonna do with the hope inside you
Whatcha gonna do with your dreams
How you gonna live with all those memories
Wondering how it might have been
All I'm askin' is to keep on tryin'
All you gotta do is hold on
No one's gonna guarantee tomorrow
But it's gonna be here before too long so...
Let's get on with it
Let's get started
Climb up or fall down the hill
Either forward or
Else it's backward but
Nothin' ever stands still
So let's get on with it
Let's get on with it
Let's get started
Climb up or fall down the hill
Either forward or
Else it's backward but
Nothin' ever stands still
So let's get on with it
So let's get on with it
C'mon, let's get on with it
So let's get on with it
So let's get on with it
Let's get on with it
C'mon, let's get on with it

In the New York bars
Hangin' with the stars
Bringin' this ol' cold
But nobody knows, oh
Will the let me in?
Do I fit the trend?
Will I make the grade
Or will they hesitate?
Whoa-oh-oh
Well it's sad but true
There's an attitude
(?)
Not worth talking to, oh
It's a changing world
Where love's not getting in
So we must begin
To write it down again

I know this
Your sweet kiss
Will make it all go away (whoa-oh)
Make it all go aw-

Is the master plan
Getting out of hand?
Has it really gone
To the head of man? Whoh
How do you tell a child
Society is wild?
How to find the road
To the meadow?

I know this
Will your sweet kiss
Make it all go away (whoa-oh)
Make it all go aw-

Make it all go away
(ad libs)

Get a hold of yourself
There's nobody else, no
Get a, get a car
And a credit card, oh
Don't lose that number
It's my identity
So powers that be
Can keep track of me

I know this
Will your sweet kiss
Make it all go away
Whoa-oh
Make it all go away
Make it all go aw-
In the New York bars
Hangin' with the stars
(?)

Uptown
It's murder out in the street
Uptown
It's murder out in the street
That's where I found my mandarin plum
That's where you'd be if you found one

Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street

Since May
There's trouble most every night
Since May
There's trouble most every night
(Trouble every night)
Where once we danced our sweet routine
It reeks of wine and kerosene

Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street

There's a special place for lovers
One we understand
There where neon bends in daylight sky
In that sunny room she soothes me
Cools me with her fan
We're drifting
A thousand years roll by

Lou Chang
Her brother he's burning with rage
Lou Chang
Her brother he's burning with rage
(Lou Chang burns with rage)
I'd like to know what's on his mind
He says hey buddy you're not my kind

Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street

There I was, the girl that you love to hate, but hate to love
Alone, I guess, you might say yes I was
And there you were giving me love enough for any girl
To understand that this girl couldn't see

I was still the same old me caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me, show me how life can be
Now the same old fool has got a brand new dream

One more chance is all that I'll ever need
Because you gave to me a shred of hope more than most receive
And here I am now that I finally, finally, finally found what real love means
This brand new dream won't end

I was still the same old me caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me showed me how life can be
Now the same old fool has got a brand new dream


I was still the same old me caught in my fantasy
Same old fool with the same old dream
Still the same old me showed me how life can be
Now the same old fool has got a brand new dream
Baby, there's a chance you ought to take
Chance of a mistake you gotta make
Maybe I'm mistaken too
To take my chance with you
I need you like a shadow needs a light
I'll follow you like morning follows night
When nothin's left ahead of you
I'll be right behind you
Shadows disappear at night
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one
Why is it so hard to find
Tell me that you're right there too
One step baby
Two steps maybe
One step closer
I'll be next to you
Baby, it's a secret I can't keep
Trouble comes and suddenly you're weak
I don't believe you got the strength
To fight this kind of love
I know it's risky now and then
What with all the what ifs and the whens
Who is there to say we're wrong - to tell us it can't be
Come on, baby, please don't go
I'm no heart of stone and you know
Why is it so hard to do
Tell me that you're right here too, baby
Baby, can't you see we're runnin' late
Can't you see we ain't got time to wait
Might be that you're scared of me
Of something you might feel
Hold on to me, baby, hold on tight
I can take us through the night all right
Maybe I will stay here too
Take my chance with you
Shadows disappear at night
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one
Why is it so hard to find
Tell me that you're right there too
One step baby
Two steps maybe
One step closer
New love, mmm-hmm-mmm...
New love, ooh-ooh-ooh...
New love, oh-oh-oh...
New love
I used to sit alone and wonder
Just who I was and who was right for me
Would I see lightning or hear thunder
One girl's kiss was all it took
To solve this mystery
New love, oh, what am I gonna do about cha?
New love, keeping me 'wake at night
New love, what am I gonna do about cha?
New love, how do I know it's right?
I made believe she didn't matter
Thought I'd prove it wasn't love
By walking out the door
I took a step and tears were
Falling, falling
Out her name, I turned around
To get some more
New love, oh, what am I gonna do about cha?
New love, keeping me satisfied
New love, how am I gonna get around it?
New love, that's what I need inside
She's so understanding
I was alone until she cared for me
I was so demanding
Now I'm never gonna leave her
Always gonna need her
Just a little taste of new love
New love, new love
New love, new love
Oh-oh...
All of you fellas better listen
'Cause I found my baby's got
Of hold of Cupid's bow
And if there's magic in her kissin'
Well, then, take a chance
Relax and let the new love flow
New love, oh, what am I gonna do about cha?
New love, keeping me satisfied
New love, how am I gonna get around it?
New love, that's what I need inside
(New love)
Hey, I won't stop new love

(New love...)
Comin' back on
Comin' back strong
Turnin' back on
Takin' the heat out in the street
Baby too long
Can you tell me how much fire will it take to get us higher?
Hearin' the news
Singin' the blues
You gotta choose
Stand up and fight, do it tonight
What can you lose
In a world of fading treasure
Love is the greatest pleasure
So let's go up, forget about down
Cause in this town, it's gonna get rough
And what goes down, is up to us
So let's go up, baby let's go up
When it gets hot, like it or not
You want to run
Though it's so warm here in my arms
You won't get burned
In a world of fading treasures
The pleasure of your treasures
Can not be measured up
Ooh, I can't free a person from their charms
But I'll tell you this for sure
If nothing is ventured
Then nothing is gained, let's go
It has begun
There's nothing in the world can stop it now
It's in control
You might as well just try and stop the wind
So give up, give in
You lose, love will always win
Start surrendering your love
Stop resisting
Nothin' you can do about it
It's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it
So relax, enjoy the ride
Don't you try to understand it
Leave it as a mystery
Bigger than the both of us
We're each other's history
Destiny
We are what fate intended us to be
Oh, can't you see?
We're all a part of some eternal thing
So give up, give in
You lose, love will always win
Start surrendering your love
Stop resisting
Nothin' you can do about it
It's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it
So relax, enjoy the ride
Don't you try to understand it
Leave it as a mystery
Bigger than the both of us
We're each other's history
Nothin' you can do about it
It's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it
So relax, enjoy the ride
Don't you try to understand it
Leave it as a mystery
Bigger than the both of us
We're each other's history
Nothin' you can do about it
It's too strong to be denied
Nothin' you can do about it
So relax, enjoy the ride
Don't you try to understand it
Leave it as a mystery
Bigger than the both of us
We're each other's history
It's the yellow brick road
It's the color of your dreams, baby (Baby, baby)
The story's waiting to unfold
It's everything it seems to you
Just take my hand and
Let me take you into paradise
(Let me take you into paradise)
Let me take you into paradise
It's the picture perfect dance
You never thought you'd find, girl
You've been waiting for the chance
True romance comes just in time
Just in time, yeah
Let me take you into paradise (Yeah)
Let me take you into paradise
And have you ever wanted wings?
Did you ever try to fly away?
And of all the magic things
You ever thought would come your way
It's comin' your way
Let me take you into paradise
(Let me take you in, let me take you in)
(Let me take you to paradise)
Let me take you into paradise
Let me take you into paradise
(Let me take you to paradise)
Let me take you into paradise
Let me take you into paradise
Let me take you into paradise
Let me take you into paradise
Let me take you into paradise

In my life, I have been all kinds of places
I have lived for the action and the thrill
Yes, I've seen a thousand children sing
A sunset in Japan
When I close my eyes, I see them still
But the road seems to lose its fascination
And I find there's a picture in my mind
Of a room with windows on the sea
Yea, she's waiting there for me
I drop out of space and time

Back in the maze with Lazy Nina
Walking the dog, and watching Soul Train
Reading the paper, going to movies
And at night we sing
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah

There are days when I wake up with a feeling
That the world is a strange and sunless place
It's a world where words have lost their sense
Where nothing seems to fit
And then suddenly I'll see her face
In a dream, I will dive along the ocean
At the end of a dark familiar ride
And I know the house I'm searching for
Yes she's standing at the door
And I'm right there by her side

Back in the maze with Lazy Nina
Walking the dog, and watching Soul Train
Reading the paper, going to movies
And at night we sing
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah


Back in the maze with Lazy Nina
Walking the dog, and watching Soul Train
Reading the paper, going to movies
And at night we sing
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah
Back in the maze with Lazy Nina
Walking the dog, and watching Soul Train
Reading the paper, going to movies
And at night we sing
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah

Da da doo da da ooh yah yah
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah
Da da doo da da ooh yah yah
Take me to another space and time
Where nothing's ever on my mind
We can do it when you're near
And you tell me you'll be always there
Whoa-whoa-whoa, take me
Take me on into your heart
(Mm-hmm)
Where rivers flow with peaceful joy and love
We can do it when you're near
And you tell me you'll be always there
Whoa-whoa-whoa, come on
Come and walk with me
(Together)
Where peaceful waters flow
Come and go with me
We won't come back no more

This is the way, got no sympathy

This is the way, it's the way for you
(It's the way)
It's the way for me, yeah
I shall never leave this place
(Mm-hmm)
Until I see a smile upon your face
I've got to see a pretty smile
You've got to show me that you really care, oh...
I shall never leave this world
(Mm-hmm)
Until you finally tell me you're my girl
I want to see a pretty smile
You've got to show me that you really care
Oh-whoa-whoa, come on, mmm...
Come and walk with me
Together hand in hand
(Oh-oh, come on)
Come and go with me
And always be my friend

I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within

I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see

I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything, but you don't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see

I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

And though I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything, but you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do


99, I've been waiting so long
Oh 99, where did we go wrong
Oh 99, I love you
99, I keep breaking your heart
Oh 99, how can we be apart
Oh 99, I love you

I never thought it would happen, I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out, no one to blame
You know I love you, 99

99, you keep holding my hand
Oh 99, they don't know who I am
Oh 99, I love you

I never thought it would happen, I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out, no one to blame
You know I love you, 99

99, I can't take it no more
Oh 99, oh we were so sure
Oh 99, I love you

I love you
La la la la la la la la la
I love you

You ask me all about my past
My other love affairs
'Cause you're not sure that this love will last
Or if I'd ever leave you
You saw me with another girl
You think that I'm untrue
For all the gold that is in the world
I would never trade your love

Cross my heart
I'd never deceive you
So cross my heart
I would never tell you lies

Can't you see you're the only one
Why won't you believe in me
I don't know what you think I've done
I can look you in the eyеs

Cross my heart
I'd never dеceive you
So cross my heart
I would never leave your love
Cross my heart
I'd never deceive you
So cross my heart
I would never tell you lies

You don't have to worry 'bout me
No one in this world could make want to
Put my love into jeopardy
Nothin' in this world could take my heart away


Cross my heart
Cross my heart
I would never tell you lies
Cross my heart
Try to believe me
So cross my heart
I would never leave your love
Cross my heart
You know I'll always love you
So cross my heart
I would never tell you lies
Cross my heart
You know I'll always love you
So cross my heart
I would never leave your love...
And now you seem so far away
When only yesterday
I thought that we were gettin' closer
It's like I'm hangin' on a line
Hopin' you'll take time enough to notice
That we both could understand
Do you wanna live alone?
Lookin' past the places where
A seed of love could grow and
The future could be lastin' love
But you just keep slippin' away
Why you wanna keep on slippin' away?
Somewhere in your heart I know
You will see that I am on your side
I am on your side
I can't believe it takes so long
'Cause something that's so strong
Can surely take away the weakness
Maybe I haven't made it clear
But day after day and year by year
I'll keep sayin'
When my imagination's gone
There's a warm reality
That helps me make the space
Between us so much closer
And you won't keep slippin' away
You ain't gonna keep on slippin' away
Somehow in your mind, I know
You will see that I am on your side
I am on your side
Don't keep slippin' away
Don't keep slippin' away, away
When my imagination's gone
There's a warm reality
That helps me make the space
Between us so much closer
And you won't keep slippin' away
I won't let you keep on slippin' away
Somehow in your mind, I know
You will see that I am on your side
And I'm never gonna let you slip away
I won't let you keep on slippin' away
Somehow in your mind, I know
You will see that I am on your side
And you won't keep on slippin' away
I won't let you
I won't let you
I won't let you
Turn around and go
I won't let you slip away

Why'd you tell me this
While you look for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be the one
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own

You belong to me
In this life
Anyone could tell
Any fool can see who you need
I know you all too well
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes, and I can tell
Tell him

(You belong to me)
Tell him you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
Oh, girl, you belong to me

Tell him he's a stranger

(In your eyes) I can see a new horizon
(Realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me
(Stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me
(Shine the light) Need you close enough to guide me
(For all my life) I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me
Well, make a wish, baby
Well, and I will make it come true
Make a list, baby
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk, now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew
(Rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder
(Love flows) Gettin' better as we're older
(All I know) All I want to do is hold her
She's the life that breathes in me
(Forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(Together) We are gonna stay together
(For better) For me, there's nothin' better
You're biggest part of me

And now I'll never leave (now I've found all I need)

(Forever) From now until forever
You're the biggest part of me
You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part of me, mmm
You changed my life
You made it right
And I'll be a servant to you
For the rest of my life
You're the biggest part of me
Ahh

I heard a car outside
I'm waiting by the door
No place left to hide
Love is just around the corner
Someone's on the phone
Don't know what to say
Tell them no one's home
And my cat has got my tongue

'Cause I just don't have the nerve to meet you face to face
Since I'll never find the words I'll find a hiding place
I would dial your number then hang up the phone
I love you way too much to see that it's just a silly crush

Saw you in the park
One lonely afternoon
Followed you 'til dark
But I ran out of chances
To tell you how I feel
Now that I'm in love
This time it's for real
But it's scaring me to death

'Cause I just don't have the nerve to meet you face to face
Since I'll never find the words I'll find a hiding place
I would dial your number then hang up the phone
I love you way too much to see that it's just a silly crush

Dreamin' how I'll get to you
Schemin' how I'll get to you
Tell me what's a lovestruck kid to do
'Cause I'm almost too shy to give it a try
Just look in your eyes and say


I heard a car outside
I'm waiting by the door
No place left to hide
Love is just around the corner
Someone's on the phone
But what should I say
Tell her no one's home
The cat has got my tongue

'Cause I just don't have the nerve to meet you face to face
Since I'll never find the words I'll find a hiding place
I would dial your number then hang up the phone
I love you way too much to see that it's just a silly crush

Dreamin' how I'll get to you
Schemin' how I'll get to you
Tell me what's a lovestruck kid to do
'Cause I'm almost too shy to give it a try
Just look in your eyes and say

Dreamin' how I'll get to you
Schemin' how I'll get to you
Tell me what's a lovestruck kid to do
'Cause I'm almost too shy to give it a try
Just look in your eyes and say
Dreamin' how I'll get to you
It's a tricky situation
Hard to say just what the outcome will be
If you solve the riddle you can save your soul
Chase love's shadows 'til the rivers run cold
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
There's a longing in the people
No one knows just when the heartache will cease
You can flee in terror, you can stay and fight
You can stand in line and scream, "It's just not right"
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
So for a smile, another fallen star
Shadows by the words I haven't said
Don't define
Just what you have in mind
Whoa, whoa, ooh
It's a tricky situation
Heaven knows just where the struggle must end
If it takes forever, I've got time to burn, babe
I won't desert you when the tables turn
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby (hey, baby)
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby (hey, baby)
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby
Well, he's standin' at her door, his hat in his hand
Hopin' she will answer, but he hasn't even planned
What he'll say or what he'll ask
Forgot the flowers and the flask
And all he's got is a feelin' he doesn't understand

Pity the poor fella
Ridin' with the radio runnin'
He remembers the songs of the days long gone
That kept his engine runnin'
Well the motor cooled down and the heat went down
But the hits just keep on comin'
Just keep on comin'
It began when he was young though he isn't vеry old
The story's so familiar, the tale so oftеn told
How his dreams became illusions
And what was clear is now confusin'
Seems he's always in his car headin' on home

Pity the poor fella
Ridin' with the radio runnin'
He remembers the songs of the days long gone
That kept his engine runnin'
Well the motor cooled down and the heat went down
But the hits just keep on comin'
Just keep on comin'
Oh~

There's a light in the hallway, a WELCOME on the mat
Will she lead him to her parlor, will her smile say "relax"?
Or will he soon be in his car headin' on home?

Pity the poor fella
Ridin' with the radio runnin'
He remembers the songs of the days long gone
That kept his engine runnin'
Well the motor cooled down and the heat went down
But the hits just keep on comin'
Just keep on comin'

Baby goes for prettier boys
With shinier toys that make the most noise
The way you look you can easily afford
To slam your door on any given night's score
Win the world with womanly wiles
Flip your hair flash a smile
Get what you want 'til you don't want what you got
Baby be a deadly shot

You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you'll get it right smack back
Through the middle of your heart

Sometime when you're feelin' alone
Would you throw me a bone and answer your phone
And if you're free you can come and see me
Anytime you feel the need and make me bleed
If the world ever puts you on trial
Flip your hair, flash a smile
Get what you want 'til you don't want what you got
Baby be a deadly shot

You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you'll get it right smack back
Through the middle of your heart

It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you, lock and key
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion, can't you see

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

I've been wondering how you are
Hope you're alright so far
Yes, I've been thinkin' about you
Jesus said seek and you'll find
You just keep that on your mind
That’s all you need to do
'Cause the Lord, He's still the same
And you know this ain't no game
These days are not made to be wasted
Come back
And stop all those things
That are hurting you
You can come back to the One
That you know is true
Come back, that's what you gotta do
You're hiding more and more
But you just can't afford
To keep that pain down inside you
It's no way to live your life
And I'm sure you'll do what’s right
'Cause without Him there's no life at all
Then you know it won’t be long
'Til the Lord'll make you strong
The truth is still there if you take it
Come back
And stop all those things
That are hurting you
You can come back to the One
That you know is true
Come back
You know you gotta come back
And stop all those things
That are hurting you
You can come back to the One
That you know is true
Come back, that's what you gotta do
Keep on prayin'
And you start sayin'
"Lord, l'm gonna trust You"
Then He’ll begin workin'
Heal what is hurtin'
Jesus is the one
That will take your sorrow away
Take your sorrow away
'Cause the Lord, He's still the same
And you know this ain't no game
These days are not made to be wasted
Come back
And stop all those things
That are hurting you
You can come back to the One
That you know is true
Come back
You know you gotta come back
And stop all those things
That are hurting you
You can come back to the One
That you know is true
Come back, that's what you gotta do
Come back
You know you gotta come back
Come back, come back
Yeah, you gotta come back
Come back, come back soon
Whoa-whoa...
Come back
You know you gotta come back
Come back, come back
Yeah, you gotta come back
Come back, come back soon
Whoa-whoa...

Say what do you think
Of gentlemen wearing mink
Gentle and soft
But who'd just as soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
(Jo Jo) Jo Jo

So look out behind you
Jojo got a gun
Though he wouldn't mean to
He likes his fun

Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
Man its way below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights
Flashing lights below him
Yeah yeah
Jo Jo
How low can you go
Jo Jo Oh Oh

Baby, I know that I was wrong in every way
And suddenly, now I've realized
What you were tryin' to say
'Cause all the feelings I've been hidin'
Finally broke your heart one day
So now I'm

Keepin' the secret to myself
I never wanted to know for sure
Love is a mystery

I heard our song, it was playin' last night on the radio
But since you've been gone
It doesn't sound right to me anymore
All this time, I've been denyin'
Lyin' to myself again
So now I'm

Keepin' the secret to myself
I never wanted to know for sure
Love is a mystery

Love is a mystery
Until you find the key
Oh, how I keep holdin' on
All because I know, yes, I do, baby
That I won't be the only one
The lonely one

Keepin' the secret to myself
I never wanted to know for sure
Love is a mystery

Love is a mystery
Love is a mystery
Love is a mystery until you find the key
Love is a mystery (Keepin' the secret to myself)
Love is a mystery
Love is a mystery
[Chorus: Patti Austin, 
Michael Jackson
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry

You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I found myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause

No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(All night)

And though I am tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is sayin', "Come and do me!"

Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the bed to see of what might be
But here I go fallin' again
[Chorus: Michael Jackson, 
Patti Austin
 &amp; 
Both
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Over you, 
over you
 (All night)
It's the fallin' in love
 (You got me fallin' in love)
Got me fallin' in love (
Being in love makes me
Cry, Cry, Cry

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm fallin' in love (I'm fallin')
I'm fallin'

Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play
Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer
All night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways

Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say
Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

Bein' cool won't help
You keep a love warm
You'll just blow your chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way
In your arms tonight
She'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways


In your arms tonight
She'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways

Ya better believe it, whoa
Love her today
Find one hundred ways
I'm telling you
To love her today
Find one hundred ways
Whoa, love her, love her
Love her one hundred ways
You've got to love her today
Find one hundred ways
Your secret's safe inside me
Closet man
Safe under lock and key
Understand
What you're thinkin' is important
Isn't really so, you'll see
But your secret's absolutely safe with me
Your lover's songs and nights
Turn into tears
Your tattoos and your muscles
Disappear
And the ring that I once gave you
Now, you're wearin' in your ear
But your secret's absolutely safe my dear
Oh, your secret's safe with me
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me
Oh, your secret's safe with me
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life
So, come out into the light
Closet man
There's nothing new at all under the sun
You've got company
You're not the only one
Why, it's older than religion
And, quite honestly, more fun
But your secret's absolutely safe my dear, don't worry
Oh, your secret's safe with me
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me
Oh, your secret's safe with me
Oh, your secret's safe right here with me
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life
So, come out into the light
Closet man, yeah
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life
So, come out into the light
Closet man
You know, it's all right to go on and live your life
So, come out into the light
Closet man
I can still recall when we said that our love was forever
All those plans we made for tomorrow that looked so bright
Ah, and I understand all the reasons you gave me for leaving
But that doesn't help when I'm sleeping alone each night
Ah, so if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
I could find someone more than willing to be your replacement
But there's no one else who can move me the way you do
Ah, so for now, goodbye, but if ever you find you still want me
You just call my name, 'cause I'll always be here for you
Ah, so if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
Nothing you could ever do would change the things I know
Deep in my heart
So I got to make you understand before I go
Sooner or later, I don't know when
I'm gonna get you back in my arms again
And if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
Baby goes for prettier boys
With shinier toys that make the most noise
The way you look you could easily afford
Slam your door on any given night's score
Win the world with womanly wiles
Flip your hair, flash a smile
Get what you want till you don't want what you got
Baby be a deadly shot
You got me right through the heart
Well you got me right through the heart
You got me right through the heart
But you'll get it right smack back through the middle of your heart
Sometime when you're feeling alone
Won't you throw me a bone and answer your phone
When you're free, you can come and see me
Anytime you feel the need you wanna watch me bleed
If the world ever puts you on trial
Flip your hair, flash a smile
Get what you want till you don't want what you got
Baby be a deadly shot
You got me right through the heart
Well you got me right through the heart
Well you got me right through the heart
But you'll get it right smack back through the middle of your heart
I'm not concerned with what some people are saying
That doesn't matter, no that doesn't matter
When I don't hear from you, the tricks my mind keep playing
I wonder if I matter, I wonder if I matter
Ooh, you've been gone such a long time
Like a fool, I let you go
You left to find yourself an answer
Like a fool, I let you go
Lovers may come and they may go
But in the end you'll surely know
I am the one that you can count on
You can count on
I spend my time just sitting and thinking
Nothing seems to matter, nothing seems to matter
I lie around and wonder what you might be doing
Nothing seems to matter, nothing seems to matter

When I'm walkin'
With you baby
In the spring of the day
Well it's a man and a lady
Feel a special way

Now what is this
That I'm hearing
In the song of the sparrow
Could it be love
Comin' to me
On the wings of cupid's arrow

Don't you know that I will go anywhere with you
Anyplace, anytime will do
I am ready to give you love so true
Showin' my faith
Seeing is believing, baby

Every time I see your eyes they make me hypnotized
Feelin' myself going, going, going, going, gone

Now what is this
That I'm hearing
In the song of the sparrow
Could it be love
Comin' to me
On the wings of cupid's arrow

Don't you know that I will go anywhere with you
Anyplace, anytimе will do
I am ready to give you love so truе
Gonna show my faith
Alright, now, seeing is believing, baby


Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby
Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby
Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby
Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby
Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby
Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby
Seeing is believing
Seeing is believing, baby

When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not catch your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else

Thinking how it's going to be
Whenever I get you next to me
It's gonna be good, don't you know
From your head to your toe
Gonna love you all over, over and over
Me into you, you into me, me into you

I am so into you

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout the things
That we said late last night
When every word I said
Just didn't come out right
And you were so afraid
That I'd found someone new
But darlin', well, there's no need
For what we're goin' through

Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman that I'm dreamin' of
You're the only woman that I really love

Baby see, what a foolish heart has done for me
Darlin' why yeah, would you break my heart and make me cry?
Well now, you can't go back and change the way things are
And all this foolish talk won't take us very far
And so I hope you're list'nin' 'cause I'm tellin' you
About the, the way I feel and what I'm goin' through

Because you and I've been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow

And the world may be unkind
I'll put my lovin' arms around you
Take you far from this place and time

Because you and i been in love too long
To worry 'bout tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman I’ve been dreamin' of
Baby, you're the only woman that I really love
You're the only woman
I know you're the only woman
Well now you're the only woman
Fighting this war
When I should have been a superstar
She walked in and I knew she was there to please
Said one word to me and drop me to my knees
And everytime she gets near but I told her over and over and over
Be mine, fraulein
Give me a reason to keep you here
Be mine, fraulein
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
So you're having trouble with your romance
Well, you better check it out before it goes, yeah
'Cause you might not be seeing things just the way you should
And you don't recognize what everybody knows
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
And all at once, you're ready to hang it up
(You're ready to hang it up)
'Cause things didn't turn out the way you planned, no
And all your friends, they calling you a fool
'Cause you don't know a good thing
When you got it in your hand
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
And all at once, you're ready to hang it up
(You're ready to hang it up)
'Cause things didn't turn out the way you planned, no
And all your friends, they calling you a fool

What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
What you gonna do when she says goodbye?
What you gonna do when she is gone?
All night and day
Just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone
The TIME that you lose
Exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down
In the cool of the night
When nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true
If you try to conceal
The way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry
I'm keeping my eye on you
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down
You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss

Mama, don't leave the light on
I'm gonna roll all night
Street feet pulling me right on
Out of control the night

[??] me your [??] through my brain
Make me a sidewalk superstar
Get in the mood and prove
No matter who you are

Running in the thick of the night
Under the city lights
Hotter than heat
Honey, we'll treat you right
Running in the thick of the night

People make believe
Trying a change of scene
Putting their part of the motion
Into the time machine

Everyone needs a dream to lean on
I wanna make it on my own
When it [??] got you
To take me home

Running in the thick of the night
Under the city lights
Hotter than heat
Honey, we'll treat you right
Running in the thick of the night
Running in the thick of the night
Under the city lights
Hotter than heat
Honey, we'll treat you right
Running in the thick of the night

Fly me over heaven
On a midnight moonbeam
Play a little magic always
Weave a little love


Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine

Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine


I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
These moments will shine

She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
And that's a very great start in me
Can't you see?

I don't know why she love me so
Why? I guess I'll never know
But I can tell she really care for me
So, I'll give her love to last a lifetime
That will never die
Oh, how I love that girl
She's the queen of my heart

She's the queen of my heart
She's captured every part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
And that's a very great start in me
Can't you see?

I can't explain the joy she brings
She's captured all those hidden things
And no one ever took the time to find
So, I'll give her love to last a lifetime
That will never die
Oh, how I love that girl
She's the queen of my heart

I was alone trying to find someone to love me
As I went on my way, I kept my search in pain and misery
For no one cares for me
But that's alright, she'll fight for me, my friend
That's when my baby, she stepped in
And that is why I sing this song for her
She's the queen of my heart
[Chorus: DeBarge &amp; 
El DeBarge
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me (
In me
I'm me (
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me (
In me
I'm me (
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
I know it's late but I can't sleep tonight
'Cause I got something on my mind
I could try one more time to turn out the light
But I just can't make myself unwind
'Cause every time I close my eyes I see your face
And I find my eyes wide open, and I'm starin' into space
Some think it's been too long this time
I can hardly stand another day
With all the miles and miles between us
Can it be that tomorrow holds a promise
Of joy for you and me?
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
In a little while I'll be on my way to you
Oh, yeah
Come tomorrow I'll be home, and you can be satisfied
'Cause we can leave this lonely life behind
In the mornin' I can wake up with a smile
'Cause I'll be on my way back home to you
Feelin' better by the mile
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
In a little while I'll be on my way to you
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
In a little while I'll be on my way
So hold on, baby, just-a one more day
I saw a twinkle in her eye
It lit a fire deep inside
But it burned so wild and strong
I knew it wouldn't last for long
'Cause love takes time
And it's hard to find
You gotta take some time
To let love grow
I saw a shooting star go by
It blazed a path across the sky
But the beauty did not last, no
Some things just happen all too fast
But love takes time
And it's hard to find
You gotta take some time
To let love grow, whoa
Well, some think love's a game
You play for a night or two
But I think that's a shame
'Cause I know that in the end, they're bound to lose
Love takes time
Yes, it's hard to find
You gotta take some time
To let love grow (Love takes time)
Oh, love takes time
I said that it's hard to find
Oh, just take your time
And love will grow
If we really want our love to grow
We gotta take it slow, oh, whoa
Love takes time
Yes, it's hard to find
Baby, love takes time
Yours and mine
Whoa, love takes time
I said that it's hard to find
Yeah, yeah, love takes time
Yours and mine
Love takes time (Listen to me, people)
Hard to find (No, it don't come easy)
Love takes time
You know I'm talkin' 'bout yours and mine
Oh, love takes time (It's bound to take a while)
Hard to find (If you want it to last)
Love takes time
Especially yours and mine
[Verse 1: Michael McDonald, 
Doobie Brothers
Oh, I hand them this life
To do what they will
They've got to find their way from here
Oh, show us the way
If they only knew
Oh, show us the light
Oh, show them what light
It shines from within
They make their own day
They make their own night
And sometimes they win
Oh, show us the way
But they always get through
Oh, show us the light

Oh, why do they come and ask for more?
They've got stars they don't have wishes for
They're just givin' up their blame to me
Oh, how do the fools survive?
[Verse 2: Michael McDonald, 
Doobie Brothers
I'm wonderin' why, I'm wonderin' how
They're gonna bail themselves out now
Oh, give us this day
I'm shakin' my head
Oh, keep us through night
Oh, I hand them this life
To do what they will
They've got to make their way from here
Oh, show us the way
If they only knew
Oh, show us the light

Oh, why do they come and ask for more?
They've got stars they don't have wishes for
They're just givin' up their blame to me
Oh, how do the fools survive?
[Bridge: Michael McDonald, 
Doobie Brothers
It's not like it was before
Not like it was before
When they call I won't come running
It was so long ago
I left them on their own
Oh, how do the fools survive?


Oh, why do they come and ask for more?
They've got stars they don't have wishes for
They're just givin' up their blame to me
Oh, how do the fools survive?

Don't know quite what to say, haven't seen you in seven ages
Can you tell that it's me, or is my picture on torn out pages?
And you think it's real, but it's just another future deal
And you know you're right, 'cause you've waited for it all night
Then you find yourself, sitting on a little shelf
Don't know quite what to do, I've been acting my life in phases
Is it really true that they're keeping us locked in cages?
And you think it's real, but it's just another future deal
And you know you're right, 'cause you've waited for it all night
Then you find yourself, sitting on a little shelf
Rockmaker
And you think it's real, but it's just another future deal
And you know you're right, 'cause you've waited for it all night
Then you find yourself, sitting on a little shelf
Rockmaker
Rockmaker
Rockmaker
Rockmaker
Baby
Nobody has to remind me
Lately
You're all I have on my mind, you see
Someone told me that if it was meant to be
Oh, Jamie
You and I could go on forever
Oh, Jamie
People might think it's wrong
Whatever
But since I've only known you a week
Even one more night would be all right
You and I could go on forever
And forever never felt so much like
Jamie
I'm not sure yet where there is going
Maybe
I don't really have to be knowing
Oh someone told me that if it was meant to be
Oh, Jamie
You and I could go on forever
Oh, Jamie
People might think it's wrong
Whatever
But since I've only known you a week
Even one more night would be all right
You and I could go on forever
And forever never
I said forever never
Forever never felt so much like
Jamie
You and I could go on forever
I tried to tell her I love her, says I can like you alot but I don't think you are the one
Spend all my nights worrying all about her
Waiting for the answers that I know won't ever come
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me?
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me?
My friends all tell me, that I am a fool
I tell them that it's a lesson that I just have to learn on my own
I might send her flowers but it ain't no use
I just can't stop feeling this way
What's done is done
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me? (Oh)
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me?
I know I can handle the sorrow
These things they happen all the time
All of this it might change tomorrow
But if i've got the time, to see every mine
My friends all tell me, that I am a fool
I tell them that it's a lesson that I just have to learn on my own
I might send her flowers but it ain't no use
I just can't stop feeling this way
What's done is done
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me? (Oh)
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me?
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me? (Oh)
Won't somebody tell me please, have you ever seen a bigger fool than me?

Once in a while in a flash of light
I can still see you fading in flight
Tell me
Where are you going
Where have you been
I'd still adore you if I saw you again

If I saw you
If I saw you again
If I saw you, if I saw you
I would adore you then

Years ago we were here
Now you're a world away
And I've been lost in an empty stare
Thinkin' bout yesterday
I would adore you if I saw you again, ooh

If I saw you
If I saw you again (you know I'd love to see you)
If I saw you, if I saw you again (oh, baby, I'd love to see you, yeah)
If I saw you, if I saw you again

I would hold you
Never let you go
Through the endless night
And we'd discover as brand new lovers
What we have is right

If I saw you
If I saw you again (There wouldn't be a shadow hangin' over me)
If I saw you, if I saw you again (Yeah, I've got so many things to say to you baby)
If I saw you, if I saw you
You know I'd love you then
You know I'd love you then

You're always on my mind
Day and night, baby, all the time
(All the time)
You mean so much to me
A love like ours just hard to be
You're the wind and the rain
You've got a river that takes away my pain
And the sky that's, oh, so blue
You're everything girl, don't you know I need you
(Need you)

You are the only thing that keeps me going
You are the only thing that keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, you see, my love is forever

Sugar, I don't have to dream
Because you give me what I want
Girl, you know what I need
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
(Love you)
Oh, oh, what does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me
I'll never, never stop loving you
Never, never stop wanting you
Never, never get enough of you, love is forever

You are the only thing that keeps me going
You are the only thing, keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, my love is forever
Some people, they just look for a sure shot
Roll the dice and then wish for something
Someone else has got
If you win, when do you begin to have fun
Seems to me everyone's
Everybody's looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
At the studio, well, they bring their own caviar
Back on the street and you're still looking for who you are
What's the prize, maybe paradise in the sun, ooh, yeah
Seems to me everyone's
Everybody's looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Ooh, so you thought that life, could be a perfect tan
Ooh, well, you'll have to think again, over and over
You've been fooled once again, over and over
Seems to me everyone's
Everybody's looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh, yeah
Looking for the perfect ahh, ahh...
Looking for the perfect ahh
(pack - puerta)
Babe, it took a long, long time to get it out this way
Now, that the hurtin's over all I've got to say
(is) that I know
Sure as I am living
It takes more than forgiving
'cause it ain't been easy
I know you did your best to please me
How can you love me
After all the years we've tried
After all the tears you've cried
After our love has died
Babe, I've seen some pretty faces everywhere I go
I say now
Maybe I ain't the same person that you used to know
But I know
In my heart I'm livin'
For the love you've given
And the foolish thing about it
Is that I thought I'd live without it
How can you love me
When you know I've been with someone else
And I ain't too happy with myself
But I keep on comin' back around
Ooh, sometimes it feels like I'm gone forever
(I'm gone forever)
Ooh, it gets so hard to wait
(it gets hard to wait)
Ooh, we're far away and it ain't gettin' better
Well, I know that somethin' is surely wrong
When I feel this way, well I can't go on and on
Darkness lights the lamps of old Brazil
Deep inside the jungle hearts are still
Tigers hide inside alley cats eyes
Waiting for you to walk by
Underneath this starlight latitude
Underneath this tranquil attitude
Oh my feelings are running so high
I feel I could color the sky
Amazon blue
Oh it's you
(Don't you break my heart Brazil)
And it's me
(And leave me here)
On the boulevard
(Upon the boulevard)
Caught inside your spell it's your parade
Refugees from love we masquerade
Though your lover is waiting at home
I have one of my own
I must go to
Oh it's you
(Don't you break my heart Brazil)
And it's me
(And leave me here)
On the boulevard
(Upon the boulevard)
Oh my feelings are running so high
I feel I could color the sky
Amazon blue
Oh it's you
(Don't you break my heart Brazil)
And it's me
(And leave me here)
On the boulevard
(Upon the boulevard)
Me, I'm just a simple man, that's all I'll ever be
All I'm asking you to do is open up to me
Lord, if I had any sense, I'd turn and walk away
The more I give, the more I need
And I can't go on this way
Givin' it all
But I just can't seem to make it
Givin' it all
You're so hard to please
Givin' it all
Ooh, but I just can't make you love me
Givin' it all
I'm on the end of my mind
Heart of steel, you can feel that's no lover's kiss
Mmm, giving me love like a stray that you found and I just can't resist
I'm up on the high wire, I'm going in the breeze
If you can give me what I need, put my mind at ease
Givin' it all
Ooh, I just can't seem to make it
Givin' it all, yeah
You're so hard to please
Givin' it all
Ooh, I just can't make you love me
Givin' it all
I'm down on the end of my mind, yeah
Being in love with you, just like putting my hand in the fire
Hoping and praying you'll give me a sign, but your eyes show no desire
Ooh, being in love with you, there's nothing left to see
Got to break away (Got to break away)
Givin' it all
Oh, I just can't seem to make it
Givin' it all
I'm down on the end
Givin' it all, givin' it all
I just can't seem to make it
Givin' it all
You're so hard to please
Givin' it all, givin' it all, givin' it all, givin'
Givin' it all
I'm down on the end of my mind

Just when you think you've seen your darkest night
Look around you
Over there someone's waiting, right now
Right now, just to make things right

Love comes just in time
Without lovin' the sun don't shine
Love comes just in time
Oh baby, love is all that we wanted
Oh baby, love is all we need

And when you think that love has let you down
And every place I go it seems like such a lonely town
You gotta just run away (run away, run away)
Just as fast as you can (as fast as you can)
Reach out now, baby
And love will take your hand

Love comes just in time
Without lovin' the sun don't shine
Love comes just in time
Oh baby, love is all that we wanted
Oh baby, love is all we need


Another day gone by
It's funny how time flies
I thought You were my friend
And I found that I was right
The way I've lived my life
I never took anyone's advice
But You showed me an open door
And a way I've never walked before
Step by step, day by day
I never knew it could be this way
Step by step, day by day
Jesus, I want to say
Although I may not understand
All the things that You have planned
I'll follow You step by step
My dreams were not Your dreams
And my fears were not Your fears
But You cared enough to tell me
What I didn’t want to hear
And because I knew You were right
I would lie awake at night
And try to reason why He died
To think a love like that
I nearly let go by
Step by step, day by day
I never knew it could be this way
Step by step, day by day
Jesus, I want to say
Although I may not understand
All the things that You have planned
I'll follow You step by step
Night and day
I can't believe how You would pray
Moved by Your words
I can still hear You say
"Give it up, haven’t you had enough"
We'd all be goners if it wasn't for His love
Oh, yeah
I want to thank You for being kind
I’m so grateful for Your time
And the hope You gave to me
Through Jesus, it came so naturally
Step by step, day by day
I never knew it could be this way
Step by step, day by day
Jesus, I want to say
Although I may not understand
All the things that You have planned
I'll follow You step by step
I'll follow You step by step
I'll follow You step by step
I'll follow You step by step
By step by step
I'm gonna follow You
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do
I'll follow You step by step
I'll follow You step by step
By step by step
I'm gonna follow You
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do
I'll follow You step by step
I'll follow You step by step
By step by step...
I know someone's done you wrong
But girl you've cried too long
It's time to live again
I won't try to complicate your life
I'm not that kind of guy
But I think I ought to tell you
Love is
CHORUS:
Simple
Easy as 1 2 3
That's how love should be
All you gotta do is trust in me
Cuz it's
Simple
Just like the birds and bees
It's simple biology
So don't you wanna fall in love with me?
You've got to find
A new place to begin
It's time you let love in
Girl, what are you waiting for?
This time there'll be no sad good-byes
No teardrops in your eyes
Girl I'm gonna make it beautifies
(Repeat chorus to end)
I see the message in your eyes
I feel the hunger closing in
As something deep within the night
Tells me that I'm in love again
I know it's not the first time
And I know it won't be the last
All alone I can't make the verse rhyme
No don't let this one slip past
Let's steal the night
Let's make our great escape
Steal the night
Hey, hey
Let's steal the night
Before it gets too late
Steal the night away
Steal the night away
I can clearly read your mind
Caught by your fire from the start
So let's not waste our precious time
Go on and listen to your heart
(Repeat bridge and chorus)
Just a cow, just a cow, just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side
Drinking whiskey and talking loud
Rough neck riders they were shooting up the town
A tall dark stranger he made a stand
Grabbed his gun and took the law into his hand
Eyes on fire he rose slowly from his chair
Walked outside and weighed the danger in the air
Seven bullets had the names of seven men
When the smoke cleared he's the only one to stand
Just a cowboy from the good side
On a page that they left out of history
Just a cowboy from good side
And no one knew his name
He was the hero then it all went black
Out of nowhere someone shot him in the back
But on windy nights when the cactus blooms
You'll see his silhouette against the moon
Just a cowboy from the good side
On a page that they left out of history
Just a cowboy from good side
But no one knew his name
Just a cowboy from the good side
On a page that they left out of history
Just a cowboy from good side
But no one knew his name
He was a cowboy of yesterday
Torn from the tales of an age
Just a cow, just a cow just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side
Just a cow, just a cow just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side
Just a cow, just a cow just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side
Just a cow, just a cow just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side

I remember when we met
Your eyes I can't forget
They told me a lot about you
From the look upon your face
This feeling I could trace
Girl, a sign you needed love
Ooh, that smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
I just kept my cool

And the more I saw your face
You'd start to stare in space
Trying to find the place to go
Ooh, it took me by surprise
From the corner of your eyes
I catch you staring at me
Ooh, I just didn't know what to say
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna say it anyway

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?

When you put your hand in mine
(Put your hand in mine)
I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
Ooh, I got butterflies
(I got butterflies)
Swimming 'round in my soul out of control
(Ooh yeah)
Ooh, your kiss was so warm and so pure
(Don't you like me, girl?)
Let's me know what I feel is for sure

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
Don't you?

Girl, you gave me many signs
I knew it all the time
When you first looked at me, baby
Ooh, you like me, don't you? Ha
Girl, you like me, don't you?
Oh, I know what I feel is real
Girl, I wasn't sure what to say to you
If I'm wrong, I'm gonna say it anyway

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?


Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

My mind didn't play tricks on me
I'm sure as sure can be
Of what I saw in your eyes was for real
Ooh, that smile you gave from my hello
(Don't you like me, girl?)
Would light up my world all aglow

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo)
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I knew it all the time
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me, don't you?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
One thing that's true
You like me and I like you
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo)
I know baby it's hard to be strong
Just take the good with the bad
And don't think you're alone
'Cause I know all your sad goodbyes
'Cause I've been there before
To help you dry your eyes
Sweetheart
Who love you from the start
Who treats you like a star
Oh sweetheart
Who loves you baby
Who loves you wrong or right
'Cause you're the spark in my life
Yeah day and night
And when trouble a-keeps knockin'
Down your door
Just call on me babe
And it won't be 'round no more
Sweetheart oh I know, yes I know
No matter how long
I'll be by your side
Singing this song


ちょっとピンクのバラを
花束から抜いて
えりもとにさしてくれる
遊びなれた手つき

ちょっとだけなら恋も
あなたにまかせるわ
今夜だけあなたの
ペースに合わせて

One little night dream
町はひとときの飾りもの
One little night dream
ほんの夢ですぎてゆく

それでいい
Do love trip
そっと気ままに


グラスまわして夜が
キラキラかがやくわ
誘惑の色うつして
心まどわす

あなたかけひき上手
酔って乱れずに
おしゃべりも甘い声で
あきさせない

One little night dream
町は恋さえも飾りもの
One little night dream
ほんの夢ですぎてゆく

それでいい
Do love trip
そっと気ままに


In the dreary world
That we're living in
It fashionable to let nothing faze you
Yeah you're above it all
You're fooling, fooling yourself
You're living in a dream
And the dancers dance
Way above the floor
And the people are calling
Xalling for more and more and more and more
Yes you're above it all
Keep on fooling, fooling yourself
You're living in a dream
You're living in a dream
So you close the door, you let nothing in
And yet you're moving and not caring where you've been
Yeah, you're above it all
And you remind me of myself
You're living in a dream
Living in a dream

I went out for a walk last night
The stars were out and the moon was bright
I heard voice inside my head
It hit me hard, this is what it said

Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head?
And isn't it always love that makes you cry?
But isn't it always love that takes the tears away?
And you wouldn't have it any other way

When you find someone who's true to you
Well, some days are up and some days are blue
Just don't go and throw it all away
Wait a minute, you gotta hear what I say

Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head?
And isn't it always love that makes you cry?
But isn't it always love that takes the tears away?
And you wouldn't havе it any other way

I used to think that love was just a losеr's game
And I swore that I'd never play to lose again
But now I know
Now I see it

Isn't it always love that makes you hang your head?
And isn't it always love that makes you cry?
But isn't it always love that takes the tears away?
And you wouldn't have it any other way
And isn't it always love that makes you hang your head?
And isn't it always love that makes you cry?
But isn't it always love that takes the tears away?
And you wouldn't have it any other way

Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock (All night)
With you girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (Yeah)
(All night)
Dance the night away
I wanna rock with you (Yeah)
(All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Rock the night away

Feel the heat, feel the beat (All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock (All night)
Rock the night away
Our town is just like any other
Good citizens at work and play
Normal folks doin' business in the normal way
This morning was like any other
Mommies kissing daddies goodbye
Then the milkman screamed
And pointed up at the sky
From Sheilus to the reefs of Kizmar
From Stargate and the outer worlds
They're 
speeding towards our sun
On a party run
Here come tomorrow's girls
Tomorrow's girls
You see them on the grass at lunch hour
Soaking up the vertical rays
In their summer dresses
A little smile can really make your day
Their kisses feel like real kisses
And when they cry they cry real tears
But what's left in your arms
When the static clears?
They're landing on the Jersey beaches
Their engines make the white sand swirl
The heat is so intense
Earth men have no defense
Against tomorrow's girls
Tomorrow's girls
In the cool of the evening
In the last light of the triple sun
I wait by the go-tree
When the day's busywork is done
Soon the warm night breezes
Start to rolling in off the sea
(Warm night breezes rolling in off the sea)
Yes, at lantern time
That's when you come to me
(Come to me)
Come to me
Our home is just like any other
We're grillin' burgers on the back lawn
Some time goes by
We fall asleep with the TV on
I dream about a laughing angel
Then the laugh becomes a furious whine
Look out, fellas
It's shredding time
They're mixing with the population
A virus wearing pumps and pearls
Lord help the lonely guys
Hooked by those hungry eyes
Here come tomorrow's girls
From Sheilus to the reefs of Kizmar
From Stargate and the outer worlds
They're speeding towards our sun
On a party run
Here come tomorrow's girls
Tomorrow's girls
Tomorrow's girls
You're not my Ruthie
You're not my Debbie
You're not my Sherry
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
You're not my Nancy
You're not my Barbie
You're not my Betty
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
Not my Julie
Not my Chloe
Not my Judy
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
You're not my Rona
You're not my Mona
Not my Sarah
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
You're not my Lucy
You're not my Linda
You're not my Lisa
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
You're not my Joni
Not my Judy
Not my Rosie
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
Not my Dottie
Not my Lottie
Not my Lina
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
Not my Cindy
Not my Mindy
Not my Sally
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
You're not my sister
You're not my mother
Significant other
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
Not my Ellie
Not my Emmy
Not my Susie
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
Not my Annie
Not my Lani
Not my Carrie
You're one of tomorrow's girls (Tomorrow's girls)
You're not my Brenda
You're not my Wanda
You're not my Sonya
You're always wearin' somethin'
Upon your lapel
So what if that ain't cool these days
You wear it well
The day that you left L.A
I felt so alone
Standing in the airport
Longing to go home
You, you
You never sing the blues
You
You always bring good news
I wanna be your lover
And I wanna be your friend
It seems that that for the price of one
You get the both of them
I don't know how you do it
I sometimes wanna pick your brain
You know that you're half crazy
But you say that you're half sane
You, you
You never sing the blues
You
You always bring good news
Abraham, I see your essence shining like a star
Like a beacon in the sky, well it's showin' me where you are
If I could have a dream come true, I'd wish for you to see
The beauty that's deep within your heart, that money alone won't free
It'll never free the beauty that's deep within
No money alone won't free (money alone won't free)
Free the beauty that's deep within
'Cause money alone won't free
(It will never free, money alone)
How does it feel to be on the wheel and running in the racе?
I bet that you would like to rest but you'rе afraid to lose your place
Oh, long ago, someone said to me, 'I'll never work like you"
Well, ain't it strange how money can change a man and his point of view?
But it won't free the beauty that's deep within
No money alone won't free (money alone won't free)
Free the beauty that's deep within
'Cause money alone won't free
No no no no (it will never free)
You can't depend on (money alone)
Ah, in this world of broad extremes outside of nature's gate
Lives the world of buy and sell (where money plays with fate)
Ah, some believe that the money can buy most anything it sees
But it won't fit Mother Nature's lock, money is not the key
And it won't free the beauty that's deep within
No money alone won't free (money alone won't free)
Free the beauty that's deep within
'Cause money alone won't free
No no no no (it will never free)
You can't depend on (money alone)
(Money alone, money alone, money alone won't free)
The beauty that's deep within, no (it will never free)
Can't depend on (alone, money alone, money alone won't free)
Gotta free beauty that's deep within (money alone won't free)
Ah, you can't depend on (alone, money alone, money alone won't free)
Beauty that's deep within, no (it will never free)
Can't depend on (money alone)
(Money alone, money alone, money alone, money alone won't free)

He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fools don’t see trying hard
To recreate what had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say, hey, only to realize
It never really was

He had a place in her life
She never made him think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He’s watching her go
And what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power, oh yeah, to reason away, now
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing, oh yeah
Nothing at all, nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
He can still believe there’s a place in her life
Hey, someday, somewhere, she will return

He had a place in her life, oh oh
She never made him think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He’s watching her go, oh yeah
What a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power, oh yeah, to reason away, yeah
And what seems to be
Is always better than nothing, oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Nothing at all, nothing at all

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now (whoop!)
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now (whoop!)
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now
Get the funk, get it now (whoop!)
Get the funk, get it now

(What a fool believes, he sees) uh, uh
(No wise man has the power) no wise man has the power
(To reason away) oh, to reason away, yeah
(What a fool believes, he sees) what a fool believes, oh, he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away, yeah, yeah
(What a fool believes, he sees)
In this place of hidden desires
Secret love that lights the fire
We can make it happen
It don't have to be your fantasy
We keep to ourselves
There's no laws of love to measure
What to call forbidden pleasure
Should we take a chance?
Will we make romance reality?
But first we must all agree to
Lay back, back
Lay back
Lay back, back
Lay back
Lay back, back
Lay back
On this morning masquerade
I'm not sure of who to play
Is it jealousy hypnotizing me
To change my mind
And stop this feeling deep inside?
Lay back, back
Lay back
Lay back, back
Lay back
Lay back, back
Lay back
If you're afraid of what you might be feeling
Just kick back, relax and let it happen
Lay back, back
Lay back
Lay back, back
Lay back
Lay back, back
Lay back
(Lay back, back) We were young, didn't know the rules at the time
Was it a passion or was it just a crime?
(Lay back, back) We gotta lay back
Remember, oh no, whoa
(Lay back, back) Whoo!

Well first you fall in love
And then you settle down
When you find someone to share your love
It really turns your life around

You gotta stop, think, and listen to every sound
You better know when another man is creepin’ around
You put him down

Well I’m not a jealous man
But honey don’t you know
When another man gets too close to you
I feel I’ve got to tell him so

You better stop messin’ around, around with my girl
You better stop, she’s all I have, in this whole world
In the whole wild world

Well that’s my baby, do you understand?
There ain’t no way she’ll ever need another man
Well that’s my baby, hear what I say
There ain’t nobody gonna take my love away
Take my love away, hey, hey, hey
(My baby, ooh, my baby)

Well that’s my baby, do you understand?
There ain’t no way she’ll ever need another man
Well that’s my baby, hear what I say
There ain’t nobody gonna take my love away
Well that’s my baby, do you understand?
There ain’t no way she’ll ever need another man
Well that’s my baby, hear what I say
There ain’t nobody gonna take my love away
Well that’s my baby, do you understand?
There ain’t no way she’ll ever need another man
Well that’s my baby, hear what I say

Take my love away
Hey, hey

There ain’t no way she’ll ever need another man
Well that’s my baby, hear what I say
There ain’t nobody (she don’t need nobody)
Well that’s my baby, do you understand?
There ain’t no way she’ll ever need another man
Well that’s my baby, hear what I say
There ain’t nobody gonna take my love away
Walk away
Or should I stay with that moody girl
She will try
To pull you into her moody world
She's down on love
And never looks up at all to even smile
And when she falls
Theres no one to call and she gives up, oh no
It's been to long
I feel it strong for that moody girl
After all
Empty hearts are the fools of love
She's down on love
And never looks up at all to even smile
And when she falls
Theres no one to call and she gives up
Moody girl, tonight
I'll be there for you
Moody girl, please stay
And fill my lonely world
She's down on love
And never looks up at all to even smile
And when she falls
Theres no one to call and she gives up
Moody girl, tonight
I'll be there for you
Moody girl, please stay
And fill my lonely world
No more moody girl
My moody girl
I'll be there for you
Your my moody girl
My moody girl
I'll be there for you
My moody girl
I'll be there for you

The family's agreed
We know what you need, is a quiet place
We have labored to find a place
Where your mind can dwell
Where you can while away
The hours that fill each day
You won't remember the life you once knew
This is your home
You won't feel alone with the people here
And with each day that's spent
You'll grow more content with the atmosphere
There's nothing more to tell
We wish you a fond farewell
Maybe you'll find someone you can talk to

Here at Sunny Hills
You will see people live and die
But how pleasant life can be

Shuffleboard at noon
And you're gonna make some friends here
And you'll find out soon
Your life here may seem a bit too extreme
And may be unfair but you soon will forget
As you watch the sunset from your easy chair
Sometimes the mind can change
But here they won't think you're strange
You won't remember the life you once knew

Here at Sunny Hills
You will see people live and die
But how pleasant life can be


Here at Sunny Hills
You will see people live and die
But how pleasant life can be
Don't look at me
'Cause I'm cryin' over you
Please don't look at me
My tears are fallin' like water over a waterfall
And please don't talk to me
There's just nothin' left to say
Please don't talk to me
My voice is shakin' and I'm not makin' much sense at all
Oh, I may never get over you, but I'll try (I'll try)
Even if it takes my whole life through
'Cause that's how long I'll cry
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight so bad
Instead of being so sad and lonely, you would want me
If I had my wish tonight
If I had my wish tonight
Don't touch me again
I'm just dyin' over you
Please don't touch me again
I know your feelings are just not as real as I hoped they'd be
Please don't look at me
Whoa, I may never get over you, but I'll try (I'll try)
Even if it takes my whole life through
Well, that's how long I'll cry
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight so bad
Instead of being so sad and lonely, you would want me
If I had my wish tonight
If I had my wish tonight
(Instead of walkin' away, you'd want me to stay)
(You would want me) If I had my wish tonight
(Instead of walkin' away, you'd want me to stay)
(You would want me) If I had my wish tonight
(Instead of walkin' away, you'd want me to stay)
(You would want me) If I had my wish tonight
(Instead of walkin' away, you'd want me to stay)
(You would want me) If I had my wish tonight
(Instead of walkin' away, you'd want me to stay)
(You would want me) If I had my wish tonight
(Instead of walkin' away, you'd want me to stay)
(You would want me)

I'm fading out of sight
My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of light
I can't slow down
Out on the open road
Racing to beat the night
No matter where I go
Guess I'll get there all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It used to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, and I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I took the one way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

So why don't I understand what's trippin' me up
I know it oughta be a simple thing

I can't hold on, and I can't return
Rivers will run, and bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how (I'm not sure just how)
But there's no lookin' back now


I can't hold on, I can't return
Rivers will run, bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how (I'm not sure just how)
But there's no lookin' back now
I can't hold on (I can't hold on), I can't return
Rivers will run (Rivers will run), bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how
But there's no lookin' back now

No lookin' back now
No lookin' back now
No lookin' back now
No lookin' back now
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, no lookin' back now, oh-oh
Hearing your voice I hear a sound
Simply takes my breath away
When you speak its wet and round
How can I get my mouth and my lips to say
Sit and talk with me a while
Show me what there is to say
Promise I will make you smile
Watch for every heartbeat each and every day
Ooh baby, where did you come from
Ooh honey, where did you come from
Ooh baby, where did you come from
Ooh honey, where did you come from
You filled my life with love
You have walked in all my dreams
Still they're brand new every time
Hearing you laugh I hear a theme
Like a velvet pocket full of crystal dimes
Hearing your voice I hear a sound
Simply takes my breath away
When you speak its wet and round
How can I get my mouth and my lips to say
Ooh baby, where did you come from
Ooh honey, where did you come from
Ooh baby, where did you come from
Ooh honey, where did you come from
You filled my life with love
I know you'll be satisfied
If you'll take a chance
Steppin' in time, stay by my side
Welcome to the dance
So turn it up, I'm burin' up
Got to cool me with your ooo, ooo, music
Come on
I want everybody to sing Hey Now
Hey Now, Hey Now, Hey Now
We'll take it uptown tomorrow
I'll make it a night you won't forget
And if I have to beg or borrow
We're gonna be side by side tomorrow night
Some say love should hesitate
But I say that's a crime
Sure you're not in love today
But take one at a time
Get your saxophone, squeeze it all night long
I got to hear a little "Midnight Hour"
Come on
I want everybody to sing Hey Now
Hey Now, Hey Now, Hey Now
We'll take it uptown tomorrow
I'll make it a night you'll never forget
And if I got to beg or borrow
We're gonna be side by side
We'll tear it up and down tomorrow
You've never see nothin' like us yet
Take hold of my hand, hold my hand
Gonna be side by side tomorrow night
Get your saxophone, squeeze it all night long
Gotta move me with your ooo, ooo, music
Come on
I know you're just dyin' to sing Hey Now
Hey Now, Hey Now, Hey Now
We'll take it up
I'll take you uptown tomorrow
I'll make it a night that you'll never forget
And if I got to beg or borrow
We're gonna be side by side tomorrow
Take it uptown
Take it uptown
Hey Now, Hey Now
Take it uptown
Take it uptown
Oh, honey won't you think about it
Take it uptown
Take it uptown
We're gonna be side by side
You and I Hey Now
Take it uptown
Take it uptown

My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, alright
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I go crazy wonderin' what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time
 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I really miss you, babe

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh babe, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Ohh, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder why
Is still nobody knows?
And we living in houses of with rows and rows
And it's also hard to see a star
So every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel? (it's way that I feel)
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel inside of me?
Every day I look at you
Every day you look at me
But no ones gonna be
Unless we get it together baby you and me
Coz I never knew love before
And I guess I never will anymore
I never knew love have feelings
So much feelings, now
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel? (it's way that I feel)
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel inside of me?
What would you do if it happen to you?
Like it's happen to me
It keeps on happen to me
What would you do if it happen to you?
Like it's happen to me
Ohhhh you
You got me really really wanting you
Each day just a little bit more
I keep on holding to stop feel evermore
Ohhhh you
You got me really really wanting you
Each day just a little bit more
I keep on holding to stop feel evermore
Every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder why
Is still nobody knows?
And we living in houses with rows an rows
And yet we so far apart
And it's also hard to see a star
So every night I sit and cry
Every night I sit and wonder why
Coz I never knew love before
And I guess I never will anymore
I never knew love have feelings
So much feelings
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel? (is the way that I feel)
Doesn't anybody want to listen to the way I feel inside of me?
Doesn't anybody wanna listen to the way I feel?
Oohh to the way that I feel inside 
You used to be her space invader
Snatching her free from King Kong's choke
She's allons-y
She'll catch you later
Now that your joystick's broke
You had it made with all the women
At the arcade nor you're the joke
Still wear the shades
But who you kiddin'
Now that you joystick's broke
Hurts your elbow
Hurts your wrist
You can barely make a fist
You're the king of indoor sports
So how come the circuit shorts
Call the number
Broken Sticks
Bring 'em in and get 'em fixed
There in your jeans
That roll of quarters
Still fills the air with lipsticked smoke
Guess the machine's just out of order
Too bad your joystick's broke
You're still playing that time-worn melody
Play it now for old time's sake once more
When you want me, you won't be usin' me
Like you've done a thousand times before
'Cause I found out now
You never change
Ain't no use in foolin' myself
You never change at all
You're still sayin'
That you're misunderstood
Won't go fallin' this time, that's for sure
All your methods won't do you any good
They've all been tried a thousand times before
'Cause I found out now
You never change
Ain't no use in foolin' myself
You never change at all
It ain't no use, you'll never change
Stop your runnin' around...

Five names that I can hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here
I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard

Yes I'm going insane
And I'm laughing in the frozen rain
Well I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?

Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend

You fellah, you tearin' up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat?
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think that I don't see
That ditch out in the valley
That they're digging just for me?

Yes I'm going insane
You know I'm laughing at the frozen rain
Well I feel like I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?

Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend


You know, going insane
Yes I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?

Bad sneakers and a Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend

Well, my friends, the time has come
To raise the roof and have some fun
Throw away the work to be done
Let the music play on (Play on, play on)
Everybody sing, everybody dance
Lose yourself in wild romance

Life is good, wild and sweet

Feel it in your heart
And feel it in your soul
Let the music take control

We're going to party
Liming, fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along

Everyone you meet
They're jamming in the street
All night long!
Yeah, I said, everyone you meet
They're jamming in the street
All night long!
Feel good! Feel good!
Well it seems such a long time
Since our love had it's day
You hope it knew the times I tried not let you slip away
Not always eye to eye looking at what's new
You know it won't be easy, being without you
You have to go, is there something you must find?
Take one last look at love baby
Take one last look at the love we're leaving behind
One last look, there'll be no more making your mind up
One last look at love oh oh
I realise you're changing
You know it needs to be
I didn't know this trust in you would take your love from me
We gave each other something we outgrew yesterdayI hope that you remember, how love it was with me
You have to go, is there something you must find?
Take one last look at love baby
Take one last look at the love we're leaving behind
One last look, there'll be no more making your mind up
One last look at love
You have to go, is there something you must find?
Take one last look at loveTake one last look at the love we're leaving behind
One last look, there'll be no more making your mind up
One last look , one last look at love
You know it doesn't seem that long ago
That I had your love and let it go
And I really let you down I know
I'm losing your love
I guess it took a while for me to see
What it is you really mean to me
I've been as big a fool as I can be
For losing your love
I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I need you here with me
There was a time I thought I had it made
But I didn't see the price I had paid
That the price gets higher every day
And all I can say is
You're the only one who knows my heart
So let's take it right back to the start
And I won't have to play the part
Of losing your love
I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I need you here with, here with me
I want you back in my life again
You're the only one who knows my heart
So let's take it right back to the start
And I won't have to play the part
Of losing your love
I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I want you
I know that I need you back in my life
I want you back in my life
I want you back in my life

I think I'll go it alone
You should've shown me if you cared
Lies will turn a heart into stone
Few would have known me if they dared

Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began
The house on the cape, the place on the sand
I'd take it all back, if it'd just make you understand

Girl, how I've tried to forget you
Now it would take more than I could buy
Sure I could lie to myself too
But that won't work, seeing that I've tried

Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began
I'd live in a shack eating out of a can
I'd take it all back, if it'd just make you understand

Now that I'm feeling assured
You'd better watch your every move
Stop, think about every word
It's looking like you're going to lose

Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began
The house on the cape, the place on the sand
I'd take it all back, if it'd just make you understand

Still, you should've shown me if you cared
You should've shown me if you cared
Still, you should've shown me if you cared
You should've shown me if you cared...
(Can I touch you there?)
(Let me touch you there)
(Can I touch you there?)
So nice when I get to you
In a place so tender
The soul of your heart
I'm so near to everything I need
And for sure you know it
I'll beg on bended knees
Can I touch you right there, baby?
Darling, you know where
Can I feel you right there, darling?
You know what I'm hoping for
Please don't disappoint me
I can fulfill your needs
You're shy and I've been cautious, too
It's a moody moment
Let me help make up your mind
Can I touch you right there, baby?
Let mе feel you right there, darling
Oh, yes
Oh, baby
I wanna thrill you right thеre, babe
I wanna hug you right there, darlin'
(I wanna hug you right there, darlin')
Let me...mmm... you right there, baby
I wanna hold you there, darlin'
(Squeeze you right there, darlin')
Let me squeeze you right there, baby
I wanna...ooh...you right there, baby
(Touch you right there, baby)
Let me...you right there, darlin'
Whoo
Can I touch you right there, baby?
Darling, you know where
Let me feel you right there, baby
Let me touch you right there, baby
Darlin', you know where
Let me hold you right there, darlin'
Oh, yes, baby
Let me touch you right there
(Hold you right there)
(Squeeze you right there)
Ooh, baby
Let me...

You had it so good for so long
You thought you were so very strong
You had too much glory
Just a little too much too soon
You thought you could never be wrong
She would always buy your song
What a sad, sad story
It's an age old story

Every man will get his chance
To play the fool
Every time he takes a chance
And thinks he's cool
[Chorus: All, 
Bill Champlin
Peter Cetera
Sonny, think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
And you don't know what to do
When it all comes down to you

If you're so afraid to be loved
Because you see too much
What a sad, sad story
But you brought it upon yourself (Self, self)
You gave it all up for fun
Now you got nowhere to run
With your sad, sad story
It's an age old story

Every man will get his chance
To play the fool
Every time he takes his chances
And thinks he's cool (What could be a fool?)
[Chorus: All, 
Bill Champlin
Peter Cetera
Sonny, think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
Sonny, think twice
[Bridge: Bill Champlin, 
All
And now you don't know what to do
When it all comes down to you
Don't think that she don't care
'Bout your Saturday night affair
And you better watch out
Somebody is gonna be there
[Chorus: All, 
Bill Champlin
Peter Cetera
Sonny, think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
And you don't know what to do
When it all comes down to you
Sonny, think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
And you don't know what to do
When it all comes down to you
I bet we've been together for a million years
And I'll bet we'll be together for a million more
Oh It's like I started breathing on the night we kissed
And I can't remember what I ever did before
What would we do baby without us
What would we do baby without us
And there ain't no nothing we can't help each other through
What would we do baby without us. Sha-la-la-la
If it's absolutely perfect, the last puzzle piece
And it all just comes together like we had it planned
Ooh, It's like when we share a secret we could never tell
'Cause no one else but you and me could understand
What would we do baby without us
What would we do baby without us
And there ain't no nothing we can't help each other through
What would we do baby without us. Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number, and I know you know it
And I'm stickin' with you 'til the end
Ooh, I'm in trouble if I ever lost you
I'd spend my whole life looking for you again
You've got my number, you've got my number, you've got my number
What would we do baby without us
What would we do baby without us
And there ain't no nothing we can't help each other through
What would we do baby without us. Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number, you've got my number, you've got my number. Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number, you've got my number, you've got my number. Sha-la-la-la
You've got my number, you've got my number, you've got my number. Sha-la-la-la
I hear your voice everywhere
It's echoes of love
Making me look back over my shoulder
Echoes of love are started all over
Echoes of love
Keeps on haunting
I'm out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold
Darlin', since you went away
Think about you every day
So many memories
About to get the best of me
Recalling the times
I used to hold you
I just wouldn't do
What I was supposed to
I've done things
I'd like to undo
Now darlin' it's you
I'd like to run to
Echoes of love
Keeps on haunting
I'm out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold
Echoes of love
Echoes of love
Love, echoes of love
Keeps on haunting
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love
Without you in my life every night seemed like a lifetime
The clock on the wall never seemed to move at all
Or was it just my mind
Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast
Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like?Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?
If I had a time machine, I'd make the daylight seem like fleeting moments
And every single night would be exactly like the night that we spent
But it won't be long until I'm alone with my desire
'Cause the stars are going out and my heart is still on fire
Tell me where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, where do the nights
Where do the nights go?
Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like?Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?
Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast, tell me
Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like?Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?
Tell me where do the nights go
Tell me where do the nights go
Tell me where do the nights go...

Whoa-oh, yeah, yeah

Perfect love you will never find
Say goodbye to what's left behind
Your release is way overdue
Let your tears be a friend to you

If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
Don't get caught in the middle (Thinking 'bout it)
If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
If you try, you will see what will be
Hurts just a little

Silent eyes make your public life
And the lies can be cold as ice
How could you ever be so blind
Bet you never ever ever thought
That love could be so kind

If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
Don't get caught in the middle (Thinking 'bout it)
If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
If you try, you will see what will be
Hurts just a little

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
C'mon baby
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
C'mon darlin'
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
Sometimes it hurts
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
It's a crime of passion
That's just what it means to me

If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
Don't get caught in the middle (Thinking 'bout it)
If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
If you try, you will see
If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
Don't get caught in the middle (Thinking 'bout it)
If it hurts just a little (Be glad of it)
If you try, you will see

(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
Sometimes it hurts
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
Sometimes it hurts
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
Well, if you try, you will see
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
Sometimes it hurts
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
Oh, it hurts so bad
(C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon honey)
If you try, you will see
It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I
It's gonna take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's gonna take a lotta love
To make things work out right
So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
You know
I need relating not solitude
Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won`t get too far
It's gonna take a lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love
It's gonna take a lotta love

Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Do you really want to know
Just how long love will last?
Will all of the bad times pass?
How can we make things right?
Ooh and why, why is the world so unkind?
We surely can find peace of mind
If we only see the light
Can't you see that?

Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Whoa, here we stand trying not to fall
Oh, there's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Can somebody tell me why
Why do our dreams go wrong?
Why can't we all belong?
Ooh, where did we start?
Oh, and tell me when
When will we ever learn?
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts
Here we are together

Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's too much to bear
Sometimes when life seems to unravel
That's the time oh to say
We're going to make it anyway
Can't you see that?

Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand trying not to fall
There's no need (There's no need to worry)
Love will conquer all

Give love a chance

I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I had been untrue
But if you think that we'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but I'll break away from you
Well, just give me the sign and I will be gone, yeah

That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby
How much I need, I need your touch
How much I live, I live for your lovin'
That's how much, that's how much
That's how much, that's how much

I sleep alone, and late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness that seems to be leavin' me, oh no
I'd give it all and then I'd give some more
If you would only love me like you had before
Take hold of my hand all will be forgiven

That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby
How much I need, I need your touch
How much I live, I live for your lovin'
That's how much, that's how much
That's how much, that's how much

So you try, try to stay in the middle
And then you cry, well you cry just a little
Then you both realize just how foolish you've been
And you try to make amends but you're better off as friends
Cause that's how much (That's how much)
That's how much, that's how much
Ooh

How's your life been goin' on?
I've got a wife now, years we've been goin' strong
Oh no! There's just something that I've got to say
Sometimes when we make love, I still can see your face
Just try to recall when we were as one

That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby
How much I need, I need your touch
How much I live, I live for your lovin'...
I used to be mellow
'Til you got a hold of me
Now I feel like Othello - dying of jealousy
Were you late last night, I passed your house I saw no light
I called you on the phone 100 times you weren't at home
Don't say just out with friends, I can't believe that line again
Don't tell me just be cool, you know I ain't that big a fool
Why must you play with me?
Why don't you stay with me?
I'm in a difficult position
I don't mean to push and shove, I just want all your love
I'm sick and tired of the suspicion
You gave me that sweet look
You cast a spell on me
I swallowed a needle
Now I'm dying of jealousy
I cry when I should laugh at your old lovers photograph
You say no need to shout, well how come you never threw it out?
What did you do all day, your mind's a million miles away
You say just in my room, well I would like to know with whom
Why must you play with me?
Why don't you stay with me?
I'm in a difficult position
I don't mean to push and shove, I just want all your love
I'm sick and tired of the suspicion
My heart is burning up with jealousy
This jealous feeling has got a hold of me
My heart is burning up with jealousy
This jealous feeling has got a hold of me
My heart is burning up with jealousy
This jealous feeling has got a hold of me
My heart is burning up with jealousy
This jealous feeling has got a hold of me

When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day)

If I had my way
I would move to another lifetime
I'd quit my job
Ride the train through
The misty nighttime
I'd be ready when my feet touch ground
Wherever I come down
And if the folks will have me
Then they'll have me

Any world that I'm welcome to (I say)
Any world that I'm welcome to
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

I can hear your words
When you speak of what
You are and have seen
I can see your hand
Reaching out through
A shining daydream
Where the days and nights
Are not the same
Captured happy in a picture frame
Honey, I will be there
Yes, I'll be there

Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Yes, I'm talking 'bout any world)
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

I got this thing inside me
That's got to find a place to hide me
I only know I must obey
This feeling I can't explain away

I think I'll go to the park
Watch the children playing
Perhaps I'll find in my head
What my heart is saying
A vision of a child returning
A kingdom where the sky is burning
Honey, I will be there
Yes, I'll be there

Any world that I'm welcome to
(It's no lie)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Yes, I'm talking 'bout any world)
Any world that I'm welcome to
Is better than the one I come from

Is better than the one I come from
Is better than the one I come from
Any world that I'm welcome to
(It's no lie)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(I got to move on out)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Any world that I'm welcome to
(Any world will do)
Are those your arms squeezin' me to pieces?
Are those your lips pressin' next to mine?
Can you explain how we ever got here like this
Love is taking over
Now we can't get any closer
So here we are, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart
Now there's nothing in the whole world
Would tear this love apart
As long as we stay, ooh baby, heart to heart
Your heart, my heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Two hearts
My, oh my, where'd you learn to do that?
I'll surely die long before you're through
I've never dreamed, I've never dreamed
I could ever get you like this
When your body meets mine
It's a feeling of a lifetime
So here we are, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart

Now there's nothing in the whole world
Would tear this love apart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart
Your heart, my heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Two hearts
(Ahhh, ahhh)
Heart to heart (Heart, heart to heart)
Heart to heart (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Heart to heart (We got each other, baby)
Heart to heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Heart to heart (We are heart to heart)
Heart to heart (Gotta heart to heart)
Heart to heart (gotta heart, gotta heart)
Heart to heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
I feel so free
Knowing that I can love you
Whether or not you love me
Doesn't affect the quality
Of the love I have for you
Simply because the heart decides
All the feelings that come through
And that is why that I can say that
Love is like a free bird flying in the sky
Far too high to be caged
It's the age of letting go
Then you'll know why
I feel so free
Knowing that I can love you
Whether or not you love me
Doesn't affect the quality
Of the love I have for you
Simply because the hеart decides
All the feelings that comе through
And that is why that I can say that
Love is here for the giving
You know that love is here for the giving
Oh, now love is like a free bird flying in the sky
Far too high to be caged
It's the age of letting go
Oh, letting go
Then you'll know why
I feel so free
Knowing that I can love you
Whether or not you love me
Doesn't affect the quality
Of the love I have for you
Simply because the heart decides
All the feelings that come through
And that is why that I can say that
Love is here for the giving
Love is here for the giving
Oh love is here for the giving
Love is here for the giving
Love is here for the giving
Oh love is here for the giving

Yes we're gonna have a wingding
A summer smoker underground
It's just a dugout that my dad built
In case the reds decide to push the button down
We've got provisions and lots of beer
The keyword is survival on the new frontier
Introduce me to that big blonde
She's got a touch of Tuesday Weld
She's wearing Ambush and a French twist
She's got us wild and she can tell
She loves to limbo
, that much is clear
She's got the right dynamic for the new frontier

Well I can't wait 'til I move to the city
'Til I finally make up my mind
To learn design and study overseas

Do you have a steady boyfriend
Cause honey I've been watching you
I hear you're mad about Brubeck
I like your eyes, I like him too
He's an artist, a pioneer
We've got to have some music on the new frontier


Well I can't wait 'til I move to the city
'Til I finally make up my mind
To learn design and study overseas

Let's pretend that it's the real thing
And stay together all night long
And when I really get to know you
We'll open up the doors and climb into the dawn
Confess your passion, your secret fear
Prepare to meet the challenge of the new frontier

Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Nothing could change you
Set and sure of the way
Charming and bright
Laughing and gay
I'm just a stranger
Love the Blues and the Braves
There is the sun and moon
Facing their old, sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space
Some walk by night
Some fly by day
Something is sweeter
When you meet 'long the way
There is the sun and moon
Facing their old, sweet tune
Watch them when dawn is due
Sharing one space
So come walk the night
Come fly by day
Something is sweeter
Cause we met 'long the way
We'll walk the night
We'll fly by day
Moonlighting strangers
Who just met on the way
Who just met on the way
Well, she's kind of pretty
Drives a big car too
And when I hold her in my arms
I never know what to do
If she's got everything she needs
What does she need me for?
I'm just a crazy fool
Comin' back for more
And I know
She's no good
Can't leave her
But I know I should
Everybody says watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy
You better save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day
Well I'd leave in a minute
If I only could
But when she touches me
It makes me feel so good
My heart's in her hands
This is a sure a mess
There's no way I say no
When she says, "yes yes yes"
Take me, shake me
And tell me this ain't a dream
Everybody says watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy
You better save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day
When I was first introduced to you
It was a hot summer night and
I was just having fun
I thought you were too
Just the sound of your voice
Gave me sweet sensations
But I thought I couldn't win
I wouldn't let you in
How did you do?
I didn't see it in your eyes
Your approach didn't let me know
You gave me time to think it over
And my mind's made up
I'm gonna give it up and let it go
(What a surprise)
You just came into my life
(What a surprise)
Here before my very eyes
(What a surprise)
Never thought I'd give my heart
(What a surprise)
You have taken every part
Like the coming of the night
You can count on me to always treat you right
I'm gonna do my part
Like the one that comes with dawn
I can count on you
You always turn me on
You open up my heart
I was looking through the window
Tryin' to find a reason
Why I shoudn't let my feelings grow
Tenderly you touch me
So nice you didn't rush me
Tonight the world will know
(What a surprise)
Have you here before my eyes
(What a surprise)
You have captured me inside
(What a surprise)
Never thought I'd give my heart
(What a surprise)
You have captured every part
You [?] me on the telephone
Your conversation went on and on
Without a word I heard you say
That in your arms is where I belong
You were in charge, I was in love
You had me hookin', I didn't know
I loved your heart, you loved me slow
This won't be easy come easy go
(What a surprise)
Just like magic you appear
(What a surprise)
It's so good to have you here
How did you do?
I didn't see it in your eyes
Your approach didn't let me know
You gave me time to think it over
And my mind's made up
I'm gonna give it up and let it go
(What a surprise)
Never thought I'd go this far
(What a surprise)
Oh baby, you are my shining star
(What a surprise)
Suddenly it's all so clear
(What a surprise)
No more doubts and no more fear
(What a surprise)
Take me all the way
(What a surprise)
What a surprise, you are here with me
(What a surprise)
Oh baby, oh baby
(What a surprise)
Your good lovin' makes me wanna shout
(What a surprise)
You took the late flight out of my life
Into the heat of a dancer's light
Where the sun never sets
One more letter
Over the water
I could never forget you
I get a feel for the island set
Vividly real in your novelettes
A satin kimonoed writer's romance
Auto-erotic souvenirs, aerogrammes of passion
One more letter
Over the water
I could never forget you

TV says you got those high class blues
Seems the caravan to Aruba is not the road that you would choose
A bar stool intellectual, with a Master’s degree in 
small talk
...
And going to the movies

Catalina Breeze (Catalina)
Catalina Breeze (Catalina)
Ahhhhh


The daytime party flowed with champagne filled coconuts
Seemed the grand marshal lacked your point of view
Your philosophies are taken from a high class magazine....
And going to the movies

Catalina Breeze (Catalina)
Catalina Breeze (Catalina)
Ahhhhh


Like a frozen angel
That's fallen down from too high
Her wings begin to open
Just before she runs out of sky
Pack up the El Dorado
There’s plenty of fire for the task at hand
A thousand suns pray to a tower
Too many secrets buried in the sand

She's got to be somewhere soon
The book never lies
Across the Santa Ana to the land of blue skies
She's on a mission with a graphic twist
She’s got to be somewhere
She's got to be somewhere soon

Never should have tried to run her
Now someone has a case of a second smile
And the only sign of trouble
Is drippin' from a turnstile (At the dam)
Hard as a desert flower
Leaning into the devil wind
The seeds might be forgotten
They just might scatter with her sins

She's got to be somewhere soon
The book never lies
Across the Santa Ana to the land of blue skies
She's on a mission with a graphic twist
She's got to be somewhere
She's got to be somewhere soon

She's got to be somewhere soon
The book never lies
Across the Santa Ana to the land of blue skies
She’s on a mission with a graphic twist
She’s got to be
She's got to be
She’s got to be
She's got to be

Spending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

All day long, I'm wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, oh baby, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh

Now that I put it all together, oh oh
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?

Baby come back, oh darling, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
I was wrong and I just can't live

J'ai vu l'ennui mon ennemi
Je me suis perdu en terre connue
Parmi le jour chercher la nuit
Dans des avenues pleines d'inconnus
J'ai au fil des habitudes
Enivré de ma solitude
Suivi la masse qui se déplace
En oubliant ou est ma place

Je reviens, de ce long voyage
Je reviens, pour te retrouver
Je reviens, pour te célébrer
Je reviens
Je reviens, de ce long voyage
Je reviens, pour te retrouver
Je reviens, pour te célébrer
Je reviens

J'ai vu l'ennui mon ennemi
Je me suis perdu en terre connue
Parmi le jour chercher la nuit
Dans des avenues pleines d'inconnus
J'ai vu l'amour du fond de moi
Je l'ai retrouvé avec toi
J'ai cru en moi une autre fois
Repris la route qui mène chez toi

Je reviens, de ce long voyage
Je reviens, pour te retrouver
Je reviens, pour te célébrer
Je reviens
Je reviens, de ce long voyage
Je reviens, pour te retrouver

Red streamliner rolling
Rollin' down the track the things you see
With your wheels in motion through desert, mountain, ocean
I hear you every night, is it a dream?
Red streamliner rolling down, coming down on me
Red streamliner rolling, rolling long so free
Your past keeps coming back on me
To far and near, away from here
Where people move a mile a minute
This hurricane living with you and me in it
Long into the night, that whistle offers light
Red streamliner rolling
I wish you'd tell me 'bout the things you see
I'm looking, looking down the tracks you ride
Knowing that they're your only guide
I see them every night, is it a dream?
And when the sidewalks roll up at night
Just as stations pass by
Once the leader of the wild, wild west
Hurricane living been a lifelong song
Now you're cast of steel and cast aside
Broken dreams maybe, but you haven't died
Would you like to live with me on a tropical island?
Would you like to sail the seven seas the rest of our lives?
Would you care if nobody was there but you and I
And a castaway wind as our guide?
We would ride over the deep blue highway
And chase the sun 'til she sleeps in the sea
And the moonlight is on the sand
And there beneath that heavenly skylight
You could lay in the shade of the palms of my hands
And in the name of love, we'd claim that land
I know it's just a dream, but dreams have been known to come true
For an imaginary captain and a one-woman crew
I see us on a ship named the Sandcastle sailing off into the blue
On a one-way ticket to paradise (On a one-way ticket to paradise)
Mmm, do you want to go?
On a one-way ticket to paradise (On a one-way ticket now)
Wouldn't that be nice?
I could meet you on the shoreline some morning soon
With no destination short of sailing 'round the moon
Seafaring gypsies flowing with the tide
With a castaway wind by our side, we'd ride
Yes, I know it's just a dream, but dreams have been known to come true
For an imaginary captain and a one-woman crew
I see us on a ship named the Sandcastle sailing off into the blue
On a one-way ticket to paradise (On a one-way ticket to paradise)
Oh, do you want to go, baby?
On a one-way ticket to paradise (On a one-way ticket now)
Wouldn't that be nice?
So nice
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be so nice?
Mmm, wouldn't that be?
Do you want to go with me, baby?
Do you want to go?
I said, do you want to go with me, baby?
Do you want to go?
Let's go on a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
On a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
On a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
On a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
On a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
On a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
On a one-way ticket to paradise (Do you want to go?)
(Do you want to go with me, baby?)
(Do you want to go?)

I heard a nightingale croon last night in town
I smiled up at the moon, had another round
You've got to be the prettiest girl I've found
And I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms again
In sunny spring we were sweethearts
Sleeping in the sand
Our love was an endless dream
No one could understand
Just like pennies from heaven
I know I cannot fail
And I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms again
So, I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms, till I hold you in my arms
Till I hold you in my arms again, till I hold you in my arms again
Till I hold you in my arms, till I hold you in my arms again

I see faces!
Coverin' an empty 'I'
Empty spaces
Where there used to be a soul inside

Nothin' and no one ever gets to them
Seems the wind could blow right through them
Believin' in gods that never knew them
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
I'm feeling love!
(Feeling love is feeling good)
I believe in love
Feeling love is feeling good!

Worry!
Climbin' up your money tree
You've got to hide it
Monkey do what the monkey see

You're on a one-way street and you're speedin'
Missin' the signs you should be readin'
That's the things you'll later be needin'
I believe in love

I believe it, nobody sold me
Always knew it, nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
I'm feeling love!
(Feeling love is feeling good)
(Feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)
(Feeling love is feeling good)
I believe in love
(Feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)
Feeling love is feeling good!
(I believe in love)
Feeling love is feeling good!
(I believe in love)
Oh, never be lonely!
Sleepin' in an empty bed
Shouldn't feel it, just a place to rest my head
But I don't want to find myself one day
Wakin' up and lookin' at Monday
With some 'whats-her-name' left from Sunday
I believe in love

I believe it, nobody sold me
Always knew it, nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
Everybody should!
I believe I'm feelin' good
Believe in it
Believe in, love!
Red sky at morning, sailor take warning, never more to love the land
Welcome lost harbor, port o' call so foreign, never to return again
Blue sky rising, carry me forever, southern light guide me on my journey
A ship in the night, on uncharted passage, cast to the fortune of the sea
A new world discovered, like a waiting lover, willing to fulfil a fantasy
Dark sky falling, far away from home
But this life ain't lonely, this life's alone
Blue sky rising, carry me
(Solo)
A light in the distance, a cold reminiscence of how the world used to be
Follow the dreamer down to the water, sail away from yesterday
Blue sky rising, carry me forever, southern light guide me on my journey
Blue sky rising, carry me forever, southern light guide me on my journey
Blue sky rising, carry me
What kind of fool do you think I am
To believe you really give a damn
You're just lookin' out for number one
You wanna win, no way you're gonna lose
Between me and you, which one will you choose
I know you're lookin' out for number one
Just look behind the silver screen you've built around yourself
You will find you're just the same as anybody else
And that's allright
What kind of fool are you gonna be
There's a locked-up soul and you hold the key
But you're too busy lookin' out for number one
What will you do, will you go through the day
Only half alive, who are you anyway
Just lookin' out for number one
What kind of chance are you willing to take
Are you willing to give just a little bit for your own sake
That's really lookin' out for number one
Really lookin' out for number one
Lookin' out for number one
Down on the corner there's a reason to smile
When those evenin' shadows fall
Some kinda feelin' that it's hard to deny
Once the neon lights start to call
People out there searchin' for action
Daytime distraction slippin' right on by
Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
And let the lovin' flow
Caught in the madness of a summer romance
At a moonlight rendezvous
Lost in the spirit of a sensual dance
That can cast a spell over you
All you need's a night to remember
Flyin' together on the highest high
Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
A little music and some candlelight
Put passion in control
And let the lovin' flow
Could be the start of a million dreams we share
So lay back in the feelin' let the evenin' take you there
All we need is a night to remember
Flyin' together on the highest high
Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
A little music and some candlelight
Put passion in control
And let the lovin' flow
All night we'll taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
That's the only way to go
Well, I wonder, wonder, wonder just why it is
That I sit around here and I cry
Is it just because I'm too weak to take the loss
And walk away knowin' that I really care down deep inside?
Or is it just the fool in me
That keeps me hangin' on?
When I should have been gone
Is it just the fool in me
That won't let me live without you?
Oh, honey, I think it's just the fool in me
Baby, I think it's just the fool in me
Darlin', I think it's just the fool in me
That keeps me hangin' on
I can't seem to help myself at all
And I have promised, I have promised, I made promises to myself
I wouldn't stay no longer
But every time I say I've had enough
I start to step and my shoes get stuck
And all I seem to do is stand there and say I want you
Maybe it's the fool in me
That keeps me hangin' on
When I should have been gone
Maybe it's the fool in me (Fool in me)
That won't let me live without you
Oh, honey, I think it's just the fool in me
Baby, I think it's just the fool in me
Darlin', I think it's just the fool in me
That keeps me hangin' on
I can't seem to help myself at all
And I love you
Oh, how I love you
Ah, look how close I came
I had myself talked into it again
Ah, just when I feel I'm on my way
All I ever seem to do is stay
I think it's just the fool in me
That keeps me hangin' on, hangin' on
I should have been gone
Just the fool in me
That won't let me live without you
Oh, honey, I think it's just the fool in me
Baby, I think it's just the fool in me
Darlin', I think it's just the fool in me
Darlin', I think it's just the fool in me (Baby)
Ain't nothing I can do about it, do about it (Fool in me, baby)
Ain't nothing I can do about it, do about it (Fool in me, baby)
I can't seem to help myself at all (Fool in me, baby)
I think it's just the fool in me
Saw her out last night on the town
A makeshift alibi under her sleeve
I can't take this anymore
Don't know what I love her for
I'm gonna lock away my heart this time
But if you see her
Tell her you're a friend of mine
Oh, promise me you will
Tell her to send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
'Cause I know she'll come back to me
And it will be like always
Like always
Treat me like the kid with the clues
Why she is as cold as she can be
When you never tell a lie
Even when it makes her cry
That's the choice I made
So now you see
That I
Can't wait
So if you are a friend of mine
Tell her I'm to blame
Tell her
Tell her
To send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
'Cause I know she'll come back to me
And it will be
Like always
Like always
Tell her I'm to blame
Oh, promise me you will
Send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
Send a little luck my way
What you thinkin' of?
Darlin', you've been with me every day
But you seem so far away, I know
No, it's never enough
To smile and say there's something on your mind
If you doubt my love
Know that it's here all the time
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know
And if there is somethin' more
Girl, I'll give you anything you want
Girl it's been so right
Nobody could ever love you more
I've never been more sure
Where in the middle of the night
I hold you near
And take your heart in my arms
Swearin' all my love
That's something you've known from the start
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know
And if there is somethin' more
I'll give you anything you want
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know
Know that you're free to go
Just be sure that what you want
Is not what you got
Hold me, oh, hold me tonight
Forever, here, my love
So you'll never fly away
Gotta work it out
I'm tryin' to hold on to our romance
We've only got one more chance I know
So tell me what it's all about
Oh, darlin', if there's still a way to your heart
I'll use all my love to keep us from fallin' apart
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know
And if there is somethin' more
I'll give you everything you want
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know
Know that you're free to go
Just be sure that what you want
Is not what you got

Looking down from a hotel room, high on 7th Avenue
Where the city lights the sky, for miles around
Crowds of people rushing by, everything you said was true
The open minded energy, a bustling town

On the edge of the past
We can build a future here at last

The sun is rising over the Brooklyn sky
Big Apple is waiting for us, let's walk on down
We can start all over, you and I
In this New York town, this New York Town

Got into a yellow cab, made a stop at Union Square
Picked the pieces up again, of our dеbris
Above The Kinetic Wall, bursts of stеam rose through the air
Gazed upon The Metronome that just stroke three

On the edge of the past
We can build a future here at last

The sun is rising over the Brooklyn sky
Big Apple is waiting for us, let's walk on down
We can start all over, you and I
In this New York town, this New York Town

The sun is rising
Big Apple is waiting

Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by
There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you


As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
(Anticipating)
Someday I'll be over you
As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
(Anticipating)
Someday I'll be over you
As soon as my heart
(As soon as my heart stops breakin')
(Anticipating)

When you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men
, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories; I don't think that's cool
Why dont'cha tell me someone isn't lovin' you?
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm beggin' you, please
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you
Now tell me, how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough; baby, that's a pity
And every man's an actor; every girl is pretty
I don't like what's gettin' back to me
Now, who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of?
Love hurts when only one's in love
Now, did ya fall at first sight or did you need a shove?
I'm beggin' you, please
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you
Fais l'amour avec moi
What's he sayin', baby?
Viens dormir, mon amour
I asked you not to talk to him
Je t'aime donne moi ton cœur se soir
I'm begging you
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers...)
Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to
But if I should break, if I should fall away
What am I to do?
I need someone to take a little of the weight
Or I'll fall through
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall
Take a little time, walk a little line
Get the balance right
Give a little love, gimme just enough
So that I can hang on tight
We will be alright, I'll be by your side
I won't let you down
But I gotta know no matter how things go
That you will be alright
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall, don't let me fall
Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall
You'll be the one that I'll love forever more
I'll be here holding you high above it all
But don't let me fall
If you're dreamin'
Sun don't you rise
I've never been lost
So deep into eyes
I won't give out
Until you give in
But I know you must realize
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
Everyone knows
But they don't know why
How much will a smile
You satisfy
Stars gonna shine
The way that you feel
So there is no reason to wonder why
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
In my life
I've felt so self assured
But suddenly it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now I can't go on
'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
I need her guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone
And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh how the seasons change
And now I'm not that strong
'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost

Don’t tempt me with your eyes
Or fill my heart with lies
If you don’t really want me to
And say, say what’s on your mind
Just give me some kind of sign
To let me know what I'm supposed to do

‘Cuz if you don’t want me to, then tell me
It’s too easy loving you like it should me
If u don’t want me to
Don’t tease me, don’t tease me
Try to please me

The way, the way you say good night
Makes me want to stay each time
Girl, you know I’m really wanting you
Marry-Go-Round
You get me so high off the ground
Now don’t you go and let me down
Girl, you don’t know what I'm going through
I’m so all over you

So, if you don’t want me to, then tell me
It’s too easy loving you like it should be
If you don’t want me to
Don’t tease me, don’t tease me
Try to please me

If you don’t want me to
(If you don’t want me to), then tell me
It’s too easy loving you like it should be
If you don’t want me to
(If you don’t want me to)
Don’t tease me, don’t tease me
Try to please me

If you don’t want me to
(If you don’t want me to), then tell me
It’s too easy loving you like it should be
If you don’t want me to
(If you don’t want me to)
Don’t tease me, don’t tease me
Try to please me

(If you don’t want me to), then tell me
It’s too easy loving you like it should be
If you don’t want me to
(If you don’t want me to)
Don’t tease me, don’t tease me
Try to please me

You wanna know if I care for you
You ought to know by now
How can you stand there just pretending
And you know how I feel

'Cause baby, you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down

You wanna know what I see in you
I can't really say for sure
All I know is I need you
More than I've ever needed
Anyone else before

'Cause baby, you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down

Seasons changing faster than they do
When we were young
It's funny but we didn't seem to care
The only thing we cared about
Was keeping our love strong
As long as you're there
I'll always care

'Cause you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down
'Cause you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down
'Cause you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down

It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time


It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Whoah-ooh-ooh
I think that I can finally see
A change in my reality
In a new and different way
The way that I can tell that I'm right
Is everything looks fresh and bright
In a new and different way
Well, I feel that from this special place
You see another kind of face
On those that didn't show
Then suddenly you find
You're not coming from your mind anymore
That's when you let your heart come through
The feeling that you find is you
In a new and different way
The place that you will learn to know
Is a place that in your life you'll show
In a new and different way
Well, I found that music is my play
And I'm living my life from day to day
With those I rеally love
And in return for what I give
Thе love I get will surely live forever
Ever and ever
Then suddenly you find
You're not coming from your mind anymore
That's when you let your heart come through
The feeling that you find is you
In a new and different way
The place that you will learn to know
Is a place that in your life you'll show
In a new and different way
Well, I found that music is my play
And I'm living my life from day to day
With those I really love
And in return for what I give
The love I get will surely live
And in return for what I give
The love I get will surely live
And in return for what I give
The love I get will surely live forever
Forever and ever
Lost your toy lover boy
In the mirror take a look
You're much older now
You used to be 23
Suddenly the summer ends
And you don't know how
It was endless fun, hit and run
Sweet talk was your middle name

Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
There's a full moon over the western sky
And a star so bright that it hurts my eyes
Tempting me to go where I can
Well, I just came down to enjoy the view
Wanna do whatever the natives do
Happily, I walk in the sand
Then I saw her face by the shore
Nothing is the same anymore
Cancun, don't let me go so soon
I need your magic moon
Shining into her eyes
Cancun, she's everything I dream
And I just can't believe
We have to say goodbye
It's a mystic night in a border town
And she tries to get me to stick around
Tempting me to do what I can
I said, "Oh, no, baby, that just can't be
But you could maybe come home with me"
Happily, we walk in the sand
Then I saw a tear in her eye
And I knew we just said goodbye
Cancun, don't let me go so soon
I need your magic moon
Shining into her eyes
Cancun, she's everything I dream
And I just can't believe
We have to say goodbye
We looked at the sky under a bamboo tree
I said I was leaving, but leaving a part of me
She said, "My heart will always be with you
And when you come back, I will give you Cancun"
Cancun, don't let me go so soon
I need your magic moon
Shining into her eyes
Cancun, she's everything I dream
And I just can't believe
We have to say goodbye

I never seen you looking so bad, my funky one
You tell me that your super fine mind has come undone

Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you, my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you

Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times

Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you

I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you

Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again
When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you

Any major dude will tell you
I hear you found a brand new friend
Well if I try to take you back again
I finally decided to make amends
Don't let me in
You know I've got the be inside
Don't you listen when you hear me cry
Not even just to say good bye
Don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I never want to do you harm
Pay no head to all my false alarms
If I should come with pleading arms
Don't let me in
You hear me knocking on your door
A pounding of a heart you can't ignore
Soon it isn't there anymore
Don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
I said don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let me in
Use to be, loving you was easy
Now it's a sad, sad song I sing
I can't remember when you pleased me
But oh, that was yesterday
It's a cryin' shame
Such a cryin' shame
It's a cryin' shame
What we need here is a little more love
We need a little more love
Yeah, a little more love
Some more love
Seems to me this just ain't pleasing
You know your embrace just don't feel right
I can't recall the love in your eyes
Now all I see is the black of night
And it's a cryin' shame
Such a cryin' shame
It's a crying shame
Oh, what we need here is a little more love
Gotta have a little more love
Gotta have some of your love
Some more love
Oh, cryin' shame
It's a cryin' shame
Lord, cryin' shame
What we need here is a little more love
Just a little more love
Gotta have some love
Some more love
Cryin shame
It's a cryin' shame
Don't go, don't go
Low down dirty doggone shame
Cryin' shame
Cryin' shame
Cryin' shame
Cryin' shame
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
Well, if friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
Ooh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our scene this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day
And how long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
(How long?)
How long has this been going on?
(How long has this?)
How long has this been going on?
(How long?)
How long has this been going on?


We hear you're leaving, that's okay
I thought our little wild time had just begun
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
But if you have a change of heart

Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

I have a friend in town, he's heard your name
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row
We could stay inside and play games, I don't know
And you could have a change of heart

Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home



You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart

Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

Rikki, don't lose that number
(Rikki, don't lose that number)
Rikki, don't lose that number
I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
That each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there, ready to share...
I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart play the part
Of the fool again
Before I begin
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Feeling that feeling again
I'm playing a game I can't win
Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let her in
Before I begin
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Foolish heart...
Foolish, foolish heart
You've been wrong before
(foolish)
(foolish)
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Foolish heart...
Oh foolish, foolish heart
You've been wrong before
Foolish, foolish heart
Foolish heart
If you don't believe what I say
You won't believe I'm not that way
And I never meant to turn the hurt around
I would be a fool to lose the love I'd found
And if you take me back, I'll let you know
I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me
If you heard the whole thing before
Then once again, I'll tell you more
I would be a fool to ever let you go
Oh I had to go away to finally know
How much I need you back, I need your love
I'll be stronger than before, I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I'll take you back, if you come back to me
Come back to me
If you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
I'll take you back
If you come back to me, come back to me
(Stronger, stronger) Stronger than before
I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (Stronger, stronger)
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
(Stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before
I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (Stronger, stronger)
By the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me
(Stronger, yeah) I'll be stronger than before
I will love you even more
Oh, I'll take you back, if you come back
I'll take you anywhere you ever want to be (oh yeah, yeah)
You're the light inside of me
Oh, I'll take you back if you come back to me
Come back to me, come back to me

When it's cold outside, and rain's coming down
It feel so good, just lyin' around
I look in your eyes, you feel it too
Whatever it is, I get it from you
And there's no place else I'd rather be
Than with you tonight, my security
No reason to worry baby
'Cause we'll see it through
Mm, whatever it is
I get it from you
[Chorus: Herb Alpert, 
Richard Page &amp; Steve George
You
) 'Cause you are (
Are
) everything I need (
Everything
You are the light that shines in me
When I'm in doubt, you are always there
Love
) And nothing else (
) is guaranteed (
Guaranteed
Like the love you give to me

At the end of the night, there's one place to go
Where time slips away and motion is slow
I look in your eyes
And I know you feel it too
Mm, whatever it is
I get it from you
[Chorus: Herb Alpert, 
Richard Page &amp; Steve George
You
) 'Cause you are (
Are
) everything I need (
Everything
You are the light that shines in me
When I'm in doubt, you are always there
Love
) And nothing else (
) is guaranteed (
Guaranteed
Like the love you give to me
You

Everything
You are the light that shines in me

) is guaranteed (
Guaranteed
Like the love you give to me

You, are, everything
(Uh-ah)
Love, is, guaranteed
I sleep at night
On a cloud high on the horizon
And when I close my eyes
My soul is struck by lightning
Then I sleep at night
Like a storm
Oh, I walk the night
'cause your head is gone from my pillow
And when the twilight shines
My eyes crash through the windows
'cause I sleep at night without you
When it's dark and the night lays me down
When the moon shines the light on the ground
I just run where my thoughts take me to
'cause I can't live in this world
Without love without you
I walk the night
I walk the night
Oh, I dream at night
It must be a madman's rainbow that I'm chasing
'cause when I close my eyes
I feel your sweet sensation
'cause I dream at night about you
When it's dark and the night lays me down
When the moon shines the light on my ground
I just run where my thoughts take me to
'cause I can't live in this world
Without love without you
I walk the night
I walk the night
I just run where my thoughts take me to
'cause I can't live in this world
Without love without you
I walk the night
I walk the night

At seventeen we fell in love
High school sweethearts, love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life

I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose

Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love, oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me

I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose

Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love
Feeling
The pain


Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
From this mess that we've made
Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
So, so hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Oh, gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Yes it's so hot (too hot)
I just can't take it
I can't stand no more, baby
We were once lovers (too hot)
We took our vows (too hot)
A man and wife
Forever
Oh (too hot)
(too hot)
Baby (too hot)
Please won't you listen (too hot)
It hurt me so bad
But I know I've got to leave
(Too hot)
It's too hot (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, baby
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so warm (too hot)
It's so warm (too hot)
It's hot baby, yeah
Gotta run for shade
Come on (too hot)
I'm leaving (too hot)
Goodbye
Don't cry

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're taking all the sunshine away
And making out like you're the main line, I knew that

'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, uh-huh
Feeling the beat of my heart

Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart

Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Mm, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down
Slow down

You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah

Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah

Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Wooh-ooh
Feelin', feelin', feelin' it, honey
Feeling
Save me...
Save me...
She's not a star
But she'll go far
So she's telling all her friends
She's only young and just begun
To see clearly
In her eyes
Nothing turned out like she thought it would
(thought it would)
And I was waiting right there where she stood
She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
She said: save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
(can't run, can't hide away)
I can't run and I can't hide
(can't run, can't hide away)
She said: save me
(save me, girl)
She said save me...
Ooh!
All on her own
She's on the phone
So sincerely...
Ooh... makin' a joke
There's no reply
She wonders why
And pays the rent one more time
Everybody's out there on the take
(on the take)
And I was there when she began to brake
(she began to brake)
She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
(save me, baby)
She said: save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
(can't run, can't hide away)
I can't run and I can't hide
(can't run, can't hide away)
She said: save me
(save me, girl)
She said save me...
Ooh!
Everybody's out there on the take
(on the take)
And I was there when she began to brake
She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
(save me, girl)
She said: save me
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win
I can't run and I can't hide
(can't run, can't hide away)
I can't run and I can't hide
(can't run, can't hide away)
She said: save me
(can't run, can't hide away)
She said save me...
(can't run, can't hide away)
Save me, girl
(save me)
Save me, girl
(can't run, can't hide away)
Save my soul
(save me)
Save me, girl
(can't run, can't hide away)
Save my soul
(save me)
Save me, girl
(can't run, can't hide away)
Save my soul, baby
(save me)
Save me girl
(can't run, can't hide away)
Ooh...
(save me)
Save me, girl
(can't run, can't hide away)
Save my soul
(save me)
You can't run
(can't run, can't hide away)
You can't hide
(save me)
Come on, baby
(can't run, can't hide away)
Hoo!
Save my soul...
Ooh!
Keep your feelings alive
I know they will survive in that place
Where years of change can't erase them
Let me see what's inside
There's no reason to hide
Be yourself
Nothing else will get in the way
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same
You can run around inside your mind
No fresh air and no easy times
Just the same
You can get out of that game
You can get out of that game
There's no need to explain
What is real or sane
For the love that you give
Will return to you
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey
Let the love out of your heart (Let your love flow)
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey
There's no need to explain
What is real or sane
For the love that you give
Will return to you
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same
(Give it up, give it up, let your love flow)
Let it go
(Give it up, give it up)
Let it go
(Give it up)
Let it go
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey
Let the love out of your heart
Let it go and we can make a start
I know that we'll never part
'Cause I will do the same, hey hey hey

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say "we told you so"
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go

I've heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say.. no
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

Being with you
Being with you
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
I wanna be with you
I don't care if they start to avoid me
Pop top check it out
Lick the foil with your tongue
Give it to your friends
As a gift
As a gift
I'm gonna write down one word
Let's change gears
You know what that makes me think about
Rolo Tony brown town
Check yourself at the door
Gimme some more
Gimme some more
Gimme some more
Of your Rolos
Rolo Tony brown town
Check yourself right at the door
Give us all some Rolos
You know you got to give us some more
Of those Rolos
I'm so glad that I met you, baby
And I'm so proud
When we walk down the street
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do
But I get this feeling that I'm losing you
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it
But it gets me sometimes
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Ooh, suspicions
When I'm with you
I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
And that look
You get in your eyes when we love
It makes me hate myself for what I'm thinking of
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Ooh, suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
I knew from the first time I saw you
I wanted you for myself
You feel the same though it's got to be wrong
We each belong to somebody else
Once it was vague desire
Now it's a raging fire
Those things that people are saying
Can't keep our love on the shelf
How long can we talk about it
What good is life without it
Love will make it right
Love will make it right
Love will choose the night
Love will make it right
Four friends are driving on Sunday
Our smiles a useless disguise
By now they know what's inside our hearts
My sweet, it shows in your eyes
Through all the foolish laughter
They know just what we're after
How long can we keep on living
This life of unspoken lies
Some will be touched with sadness
But how can we stop the madness
Love will make it right
Love will make it right
Love will choose the night
Love will make it right
Some will be touched with sadness
But how can we stop the madness
Love will make it right
Love will make it right
Love will choose the night
Love will make it right

I sometimes wonder why all the flowers have to die
I dream about you and now summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight, come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right, you can go
Oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

Oh, I won't talk about the past
How love's supposed to last forever
And you, don't have to take a stand, lay out any plans
Come on over tonight, come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right, you can go
Oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

Come on over tonight, come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go

On a cool night, let me hold you
On a cool, just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
On a cool night, let me hold you
On a cool, just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
On a cool night

Keep the fire bright

There's a river in the evening ember glow
And you're wishing you could see how far it flows
Rolling on to an endless sea
You'd be well on your way
If you could only set sail
But dreams can drift away
And sails can fill with doubt
Where's your vision if the embers flicker out?
Don't let it slip from view
The horizon's awaiting
Your river is fading

So keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night
And believe the sun will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
But for tonight
Just keep the fire burning bright

I will never need to ask
What have I done?
Comes a moment when it's clear
There's only one
Oh, whatever you need of me
I've made up my mind
I give you more than you've asked for
There are those who can foresee where we will go
All the future I don't really want to know
Only that you'll be here with me
While the embers still glow
We'll be safe 'til tomorrow

Keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night
And believe the sun will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
For tonight
Just keep the fire burning bright
Keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night
And believe the sun will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
For tonight
Just keep the fire burning

Keep the fire bright
Who are you? Where are you?
You're not alone, it's so wonderful
Keep the fire bright
Who are you? Where are you?
You're not alone, it's so wonderful
Keep the fire bright
Who are you? Where are you?
You're not alone, it's so wonderful
Keep the fire bright
Who are you? Where are you?
You're not alone
Keep the fire bright
Hear my silence, see my blindness
A love ascending, and never ending
You did cut me, from the same tree
A love incision, my inner vision
Loving on our hands and knees
Always trying hard to please
Never in my life have I
Questioned or discovered why
Live and discover
Take from each other
A love believing
And never decieving
Loving on our hands and knees
Always trying hard to please
Never in my life have I
Questioned or discovered why
Him say leave now
Give and believe how
A love revealing
My inner feeling
Been thinking 'bout you all night
Guess you got me in your spell
But I think that I'll be allright
Even if I don't get well....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....
I can still remember
What you told me with your eyes
One kiss
Now it's down to this
Guess it's time you realize
Hey, Miss Sun, what could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon
Got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms
Has you back in my arms.....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning
Has you back in my arms
In my arms..... ooh.... ooh.... ah.... ah....ahh
Yeah..... yeah, yeah ,yeah
Hey , Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in my way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....
One kiss is what I need.....
One kiss.... give it to me......
It won't be long until the morning has you......
Won't be long until the morning has you back in my arms......
One kiss....I realize
One kiss....I can see it in your eyes
Oh, it won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms.....
If you only knew how you linger
In my heart of hearts, there's a will
There's a will
Give me ha-ha, yeah
Say you love me
You know life can seem such a bitter pill
When you're alone
You lend your body and soul
Tryin' to get back in control
You give your all in the game
And though your mind may change
You know your heart remains the same
If you only knew how I suffer
When you do me out, I decline
I decline
Give me ha-ha, yeah
Say it matters
You know love can draw such a slender line
Ain't it the truth?
You lend your body and soul
Tryin' to get next to your role
Try, try
You give your all in the game
And though your mind may change
You know I love you just the same
Yeah, you lend your body and soul
Tryin' to get next to your role
Try, try
You give your all in the game
Though your mind may change
Listen to me, girl
You know your heart remains
Listen to me, girl
You know, mind may change
You know your heart remains
Listen to me, girl
You got to listen to me, girl

You know your mind may change
Listen to me, girl

You know your mind may change
You know your heart remains
(Listen to me, girl)
Whoa, whoa, whoa

(Listen to me, girl)
You got to...
(Listen to me, girl)

Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra
Is he wearing a familiar face
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue
With the princess dipped in lace
Does he know that I'm a soldier of fortune
And not a victim of circumstance
We drew lots for his soft underbelly
Now his fate is sealed with my lance

I can tell by the look in your eye
You've never seen the man with nothing to say
I can tell by the look in your eye
You'd better watch yourself
St. George is on his way

Is it true that he's a mighty warrior
And a viper of the first degree
I've been sentenced here to slay the giant
Geld this fear I cannot see

I can tell by the look in your eye
You've never seen the man with nothing to say
I can tell by the look in your eye
You'd better watch yourself
St. George is on his way

Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra
Is he wearing a familiar face
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue
In the slums of Satan's grace

I can tell by the look in your eye
You've never seen the man with nothing to say
I can tell by the look in your eye
You'd better watch yourself
St. George is on his way
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
Well, if friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day
How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
Ooh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our scene this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day
And how long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
(How long?)
How long has this been going on?
(How long has this?)
How long has this been going on?
(How long?)
How long has this been going on?
Hope they never end this song
This could take us all night long
I looked at the moon and I felt blue
Then I looked again and I saw you
Eyes like fire in the night
Bridges burning with their light
Now I want to spend the whole night through
And Honey, Yes, I'd like to spend it all on you
Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way...
They might fade and turn to stone
Let's get crazy all alone
Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
Close your eyes and I'll be there
After all is said and done
After all you are the one
Take me up your stairs and through the door
Take me where we don't care anymore...
Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me... would you
Leading me to feel this way...
Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way...

How come he don't come and 
P.L.P. with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn off the TV
And hang that sign on the door?
Well, we call, and we call
"How come?", we say
Hey, what could make a boy behave this way, yeah?
Well, he learned all of the lines now
And every time
He don't, uh, stutter when he talks
And it's true, it's true
He sure has acquired
This kind of cool and inspired sort of jazz when he walks
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
If, if this ain't healthy, it is some kinda clean

But that means that Chuck E.'s in love, my, my
Chuck E.'s in love, love, love, love
Chuck E.'s in love, uh-huh
Chuck E.'s in

I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something that I've got to see
Is he here?
I look in the pool hall
But is he here?
I look in the drugstore
But is he here?
No, he don't come here no more

Well, I tell you what
I saw him
He was sittin' behind us
Down at the 
Pantages
And whatever it is
That he's got up his sleeve
Well, I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name?
Is that her there?
Oh, Christ, I think he's even combed his hair
And is that her?
Well, then, what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be the same
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E.'s in love with the little girl singing this song
And don't you know

Chuck E.'s in love, yeah, yeah
Chuck E.'s in love, love, love, love
Chuck E.'s in love, my, my
Chuck E.'s in
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
He's in love, love, love with me


想い出すあの夜の君は
微笑んでうつむいた

誰にも知られたくない
君はそう言いながら
ひそかな浮気心を僕に見せた

So lonely day何もかも知っていたよ
この想い君には届かない

別れ際こみあげる
想い伝えずに
捨てゼリフ

駆け出す僕の背中に
君はクラクション鳴らす
振り向くこともできない
心われる

So lonely dayさよならさ
これ以上君のそばにいたなら
戻れない


夜の風を受けながら
僕は通り駆け抜ける
束の間のときめきさえ
いまは彼方

So lonely day何もかも知っていたよ
この想い君には届かない

So lonely dayさよならさ
これ以上君のそばにいたなら
戻れない
Wow

So lonely day, uuh
From the album THE LONGEST ROAD (1980)
People get a little to loose. They forget, they abuse
Well, people get a little too tight, and it ain't right
You're in your car, driving too fast. You're pushing hard, just trying to get past
Oh and they just don't care about the little white lies. Yeah, they'll unwind
Oh, I don't know if it's wrong or it's right. Oh, I only know the feeling tonight
Too loose, too tight. Where is the light?
You're in your house, just trying to be cool. The radio's on by the swimming pool
Oh and your people get, say you're a-movin' to slow. Now where do you go?
Stars, they only try to come out at night. 
Too loose, too tight. Where is my light? Where is my light?
Oh, you're in a bad way. You know I can hear you call
Ah the shadow's great, the rain is about to fall
Oh and you try to rest, too much to beat it all. Lose it all
Stars, they only try to come out at night. 
Too loose, too tight. Where is the light? Stars . . 
Stars, they only want to come out at night. Stars, they only come to fill up the night. Stars, stars
Stars, they only want to come out at night. Stars, they only come to fill up the night. Stars, stars
There was a place in East St. Louis
It was in nineteen fifty nine
When they played they filled the streets with music
That lonely blue note music
That takes your cares away, far away
They packed the place when the band was playin'
To get some joy from a smoke filled room
Through that door you could see the bodies swayin'
The blue note band was playin'
Some lonely blue note song, all night long
Oh, it carried me away, oh, carried me away
Oh, it carried me away, oh, carried me away
No place I'd rather stay
If you should ever make it to St. Louis
On some hot and lonely night
If you listen you can hear that blue note music
They fill the streets with music
It carries you away, far away
Oh, it carried me away, oh, carried me away
Oh, it carried me away, oh, carried me away
No place I'd rather stay
Back in double-o-seven
Miss M was queen
She could roll like a pro rolls
When she was seventeen
Whether straight or hammered
She was the best in town
When she release the red ball
All the pins fall down
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Miss Marlene
We’re still bowling
Every Saturday night
Saturday night
Your move to the lane, child
Played on my heartstrings
With the long skinny legs, child
And your hoop earrings
When the stakes are sky-high
That’s when you'd always shine
The ball would ride a moonbeam
Down the inside line
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Miss Marlene
We’re still bowling
Every Saturday night
Saturday night
And then, one night
Something came apart
You were throwin' back hurricanes
And we knew someone
Had played with your heart
You ran into the dark street
At University Place
The cab came up so fast that
We saw your laughin' face
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Miss Marlene
We’re still bowling
Every Saturday night
Sometimes on a league night
I catch her scent again
Her hand guiding my hand
We drop the seven-ten
Can’t you hear the balls rumble?
Can’t you hear the balls rumble
Miss Marlene
We’re still bowling
Every Saturday night
Saturday night
Every Saturday night (x4)
Hey, take a look at me hidin' in these blues
You'd think that all I ever did was lose
Well, tell me why the only thing I feel is angry and confused
Tired of all these hypocrites and so-called friends
It seems that I'm the only one who makes amends
Wouldn't give a damn if I ever saw them all again
'Cause complicated times are makin' me crazy
Simplistic minds are makin' me lazy
And catastrophic dreams are makin' me cry
Paranoic fears are makin' me lie
Symbolistic signs arе gettin' me high
Maybe I'll just catch a boat or a planе
And travel down to Ecuador or Spain
I'll buy myself a fisherman's net and work away the pain
Maybe I'll just quit the game forevermore
I'll walk inside my room and simply close the door
I'll leave 'em all to wonder why I had to do such a crazy thing for
'Cause complicated times are makin' me crazy
Simplistic minds are makin' me lazy
Catastrophic dreams are makin' me cry
Paranoic fears are makin' me lie
Symbolistic signs are gettin' me high
'Cause complicated times are makin' me crazy
Simplistic minds are makin' me lazy
Catastrophic dreams are makin' me cry
Paranoic fears are makin' me lie
Symbolistic signs are gettin' me high, yeah
Well, take a look at me hidin' in these blues
You'd think that all I ever did was lose
Well, tell me why the only thing I feel is angry and confused
I'm so angry and confused
I'm so angry and confused, yeah
Just a little bit crazy
(Complicated times are makin' me crazy)
(Complicated times are makin' me crazy)
Makin' me crazy
(Complicated times are makin' me crazy)
Makin' me lazy
(Complicated times are makin' me crazy)
Gettin' me hazy
If I could, then I would
But I can't so I don't
But I will if I still have to act that way
Never felt so alone now
A funny kind of way to feel
When you just don't know
How to feel with the people
That you meet on the street
Yeah
Whoo
Catastrophic dreams are makin' me cry
Paranoic fears are makin' me lie
Symbolistic signs are gettin' me
High, high, high, high
Whoo
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody, anybody?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?
Does anybody know the reason?

The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your o.k
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smilin' bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
Cause southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from 
Ole Miss
Class of seven four gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again

Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right



We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
Cause me and noon are itching to play
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothin' like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

Well, I guess I needed a miracle
If I was gonna make my flight
I had to get to gate 
C13
And it was still way out of sight
Something in my carry-on bag
Tipped off the x-ray machine
'Cause then an angel straight from heaven
Asked me to "step behind that screen"
And when I felt the wand sweep over me
You know I never felt so clean
Well, girl 
you won't find my name on your list
Honey you know I ain't no terrorist
Confiscate my shoes, my cellphone
You know I love, love, love you
Security Joan
I hung out at the Starbucks
'Til just around boarding time
Then I strolled on back to the checkpoint
Just one thing on my mind
She flashed that crooked smile and said
"Well, I believe you missed your flight"
I said, "There's been a minor change of plan
And I'll be stayin' for one more night"
I could tell from the way she looked at me
Everything was gonna be all right
Well, girl you won't find my name on your list
Honey, you know I ain't no terrorist
Confiscate my shoes, my cellphone
You know I love, love, love you
Security Joan, search me now
Well, girl you won't find my name on your list
Honey, you know I ain't no terrorist
Confiscate my shoes, my cellphone
You know I love, love, love you
Security Joan, hey, now

Love
Love will keep us together
Think of me, babe whenever
Some sweet talking girl comes along
Singing his song
Don't mess around
You just got to be strong

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

You
You belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those girls start hanging around
Talking me down
Hear with your heart
And you won't hear a sound

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

Young and beautiful
Someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turnin' you on
I will, I will, I will
I will, be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before
And I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need you now and I need you then

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will, I will
You better stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?
How to tell you, girl
I want to build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I want to make you understand
I'm talking about a lifetime plan

That's the way it began
We were hand-in-hand
Glenn Miller's band
Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more
And the Porter tune ("Night and Day")
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
On the way back home
I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?
Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favourite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late
I can hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing


Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!
[Verse 1: Warren G &amp; 
Nate Dogg
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said "Let's do this!"
I jumped out the ride and said "What's up?"
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said "I'm stuck!"
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix
[Verse 2: Warren G &amp; 
Nate Dogg
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said "Damn, what's next?"
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg &amp; 
Warren G
I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, "Ooh, I like your size!"
She said, "My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[Outro: Warren G &amp; 
Nate Dogg
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords, strings, we brings melody, G-funk
Where rhythm is life and life is rhythm
If you know like I know, you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high like every day
And if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate
Hard days I'm travelling
Alone for too long
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm always somewhere
That I never belong
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm moving so fast now
It doesn't seem true
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm getting closer
But I don't know what to
Ooh, I'm missing you
Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
This life I'm living's
Getting so hard to feel
Ooh, I'm missing you
The days are empty
And the nights are unreal
Ooh, I'm missing you
Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life
Hard days I'm travelling
Alone for too long
Ooh, I'm missing you
I'm always somewhere
That I never belong
Ooh, I'm missing you
Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life
I found a cigarette circled with lipstick
And the lingering of perfume in the room
The look on his face was priceless
I don't think he expected me so soon
I'm sure he's got an innocent excuse
Except for the snapshot
He doesn't know I've got
(I've got!
Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot
That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He think he's got one on me
But he hasn't seen the snapshot
He says he bought the new car
Strictly for business
And the new clothes
Match the new smile on his face
The extra key on his chain must be to the office
Poor baby
Leaving early, staying late
He's got an alibi for every move he makes
Except for the snapshot
He doesn't know I've got
(I've got!
Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot
That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He think he's got one on me
But he hasn't seen the snapshot
When he comes home tonight
It'll be his surprise
I had it blown up, life size!
(Life size!)
I'm not quite as foolish as you thought I'd be
I took everything
Including the snapshot
He don't know I've got
(I've got!
Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot
That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He thinks he's got one on me
But he hasn't seen the snapshot
Except for the snapshot
He don't know I've got
(I've got! Uh-huh!)
He almost pulled off the perfect lover's crime
Except for the snapshot
That puts me on top
(On top!
Uh-huh!)
He thinks he's got one on me
But wait 'til he sees the snapshot
Come back again
I want you to stay next time
'Cause sometimes the world ain't kind
When people get lost like you and me
I just made a friend
A friend is someone you need
But now that he had to go away
I still feel the words that he might say
Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see
Turn on your heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon
You and me
He's lookin' for home
'Cause everyone needs a place
And home's the most excellent place of all
And I'll be right here if you should call me
Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see
Turn on your heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon
You and me
And home's the most excellent place of all
And I'll be right here if you should call me
Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see
Turn on your heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon
You and me
Turn on your heartlight now
Turn on your heartlight now
Now we may begin all over again
To build that dream we sought
Oh, what a bad start
Now we may begin from where we left off
To find that truth we lost
No matter the cost
I ve grown a little stronger
As you live, you learn
Learn the ways of wisdom
What a fool I was
It took a little longer
To put it all together
I should have known better
That a bad dream always ends
Now we may begin, it s just like the fall
We re on a sad and lonely road
A long way to home
I ve grown a little stronger
As you live, you learn
I ve learned the ways of wisdom
What a fool I was
It took a little longer
To put it all together
I should have known better
That a bad dream always ends
Now we may begin, it s just like the fall
We re on a sad and lonely road
With a long way to go, mmm
A long, long way to go
Took a little time, yeah, yeah
Got a long, long way to go
地平の向こうから
輝き出す sunshine
Taking the first light
光の中 始った 長い旅
朝のざわめきに 動き出した airport
Taking a new line 何処へだって
飛んで行く 時間を手に入れた
風を切る翼は すぐに空にとどく
遠ざかる地平に 重なり合う雲を
突き抜ける
From the east, to the west
I've lost myself in the night for your love
From the north, I'm getting to the south
I'll find a brand new breathing for you
風が運ぶ morning
行くあてなとない
Taking the first light
動き出した人生を ー人でためす時
風に乗る翼は 南の空へ飛ぶ
果てしなく広がる 青い海と空へ 消えてゆく
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south
From the east, to the west
From the north, to the south

Over by the window
There's a pack of cigarettes
Not my brand, you understand
Sometimes the girl forgets
She forgets to hide them
I know who left those smokes behind
She'll say, "Oh, he's just a friend"
And I'll say, "Oh, I'm not blind" to

Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him

Don't know what he looks like
Don't know who he is
Don't know why she thought that I
Would say "What's mine is his"
I don't want to own her
But I can't let her have it both ways
Three is one too many of us
She leaves with me or stays with

Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him

If she wants him, she can have him
Just exactly how we once were
It's goodbye to he and I
And back to me and her without

Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
Time for me to make the girl see
It's me or it's him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
Time for me to make the girl see
It's me or it's him
(m. riperton - r. rudolph)
If you come with me
I will show you things you always dreamed of
We can make it happen on our island in the sun
Every morning we will swim in
Cool clear sparkling waters
Wrapped in purple satin nights
We'll make slow love
If you come with me
Please bring all your secret yernings
You'll find what you need on our island in the sun
Close your eyes and you will hear the palm trees gently swaying
I can hardly wait to get my hands on you
Time is wastin'
Come pluck the fruit your mind is tastin'
Or will you keep on chasin'
"if only it could be"
If you come with me
We'll live happy ever after
We could be so free on our island in the sun
Secret thoughts your heart conceals like ancient buried treasures
Will at last be whispered in love's ear
Time is wastin'
Come pluck the fruit your mind is tastin'
Or will you keep on chasin'
"oh, if only it could be"
Come with me
We could be so free
If you come with me
We could be so happy
Come to my island
Come to my island
Come to my island

Everybody said, "now stay and wait
"Til you find out what is real."
So i flew halfway 'cross the states
Just to tell you what I really feel
And now I'm sinking in an ocean of tears
And I'm thinking of how it felt with you near
And wondering how I'll get out of this
When all I wanted was one more kiss
Keep your distance
There's no romance here
She said "a friend you will always be
Aw, your mind is hazy
Mine is clear, "
But my love can't stay hidden
It is free
And now I'm sinking in an ocean of tears
And I'm thinking of how it felt with you near
And wondering how I'll get out of this
When all I wanted was one more kiss
Oooh and now I'm sinking in an ocean of tears
And I'm thinking of how it felt with you near
And wondering how I'll get out of this
When all I wanted was one more
Kiss
When all I wanted was one more kiss
When all I wanted was one more kiss
Kiss
Yes
Yes
Yeah
Yes
Yeah
Yeah
Andy (yes, yeah)
It's coming around again, change is in the air
It doesn't always need a name
You don't have to see it to know it's there
But you can feel it
You can feel it
You can feel it
(Oh, you can feel it)
(Aaah)
In the air
Everything's changing, it happens all the time
Don't think too much about it, it'll leave you mystified
'Cause you can feel it
You can feel it
(oh you can feel it)
You can feel it
You can feel it
In the air
In the air
It's coming around again
Change is in the air
It doesn't always need a name
You don't have to see it
To know it's there
'Cause you can feel it
You can feel it
You can feel it
You can feel it
In the air
You can feel it
You can feel it
You can feel it
In the air
We're on the shores of nowhere looking out to sea
I turn to kiss your face and you laugh at me, you laugh at me
How do I feel well I feel like praying, feel like singing
Feel so good, so right, to be with you tonight
So good, so right, be with you tonight
So good, so right, be with you tonight
There is no space between the ocean you and me
Exchanging life-force as we live and breathe, together we'll be
How do I feel, well I feel like being
Feel like singing, feel so good, so right
Just to be with you tonight
So good, so right, be with you tonight
So good, so right, be with you tonight
How do I feel well I feel like praying, feel like saying
Feel so good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right, be with you tonight
So good, so right, be with you tonight

Sometimes in this world of trouble
We find it so hard to carry on
If you stop and think about it
You will see what's going on
If happiness is your desire
Inside of yourself you hold the key
Just have faith in what you're doing (doing)
Be yourself (be yourself), and you'll be free

You are you, and I am me
That's the way it was meant to be
Be yourself in everything you do
Don't give up, 'cause it's all left up to you
Open up your eyes, open up your heart (open up your heart)
So we can fill this world with love...

(Be yourself) you just got to be
(No one else) no one else
(Be yourself) I don't care what the people say
You got to be yourself, be yourself today
(Be yourself, no one else) I wanna see you be...

Be yourself in everything you do
Don't give up, 'cause it's all left up to you
Open up your eyes, open up your heart
So we can fill this world with love

(Be yourself) you just got to be
(No one else) no one else
(Be yourself) I don't care, no, I don't care
I said I don't care...

Ooh, hey
Ooh, hey
I left my heart in another's hands

Why I feel the need to testify

Do, do,do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

I swear at times I can see right through
But just can't seem to make it stay, yeah
(Tell me, tell me)

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love (Prove my love)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

To prove my love

Ooh, hey (Work it, work it)
Ooh, hey (Work it, work it)
I mapped a course through the track of space
(Tell me, tell me)
It brought me straight to you
(It's all right)
I swear at times I don't comprehend
(Tell me, tell me)
But I know I've got to see it through, yeah

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

You and I don't have to hurry

There's a troubled look on your face
And it would only take the time
It takes for me to talk to you (Talk to you)
Talk to you

And now and then we've got to question
Am I right, I may be wrong
And the only way we can work it out
We've got to try to give and take
And it will only take the time
It takes for me to talk to you (Talk to you)

But don't turn me away (Away, away, away, away, away)

But don't go making me promises
When you know that you're wrong
You're not true
So when you find out where your heart is
Let me know
I'll be waiting for you

You and I don't have to hurry
Take your time now don't you worry
Let me know what you're going through
There's a troubled look on your face
And it will only take the time
It takes for me to talk to you (Talk to you)

Maureen
It's hard to explain
I'm never gonna see you again
And you'll never meet my new friends
Maureen, I miss you
I just can't explain
I'm never gonna see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends
Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-cart town
And I miss you, Maureen
We're as thick as thieves
Maureen, Maureen
Remember when my mother said to me
"Sade, don't you come home too late
'Til you're back, I stay awake"
And Maureen
With the boys you could tell at a glance
You'd say "He looks good
Let's hope he can dance"
Wicky wacky party to the...
Where are we going tonight
And what will you be wearing
Shone like a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-cart town
And I miss you, Maureen
I miss you, girl
You were my best friend
Never gonna see you again, Maureen
And you'll never meet my new friends
You really were a pearl in my world, Maureen
Maureen
It's hard to explain
You'll never go 'round to see me again
You'll never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends

Well, just a-look at that girl
With the lights comin' up in her eyes
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
All the guys on the corner stand back
And let her walk on by
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so fine

She's probably somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right

I heard her talkin' with her friend
When she thought nobody else was around
She said she's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
‘Cause when the cars and the signs and the streetlights
Light up the town
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so

She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

I try to shut my eyes
But I can't get her outta my sight
I know I'm gonna know her
But I gotta get over my fright
Well, I'm just gonna walk up to her
I'm gonna talk to her tonight

Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight

Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Yeah
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
When you're having those days when you're feeling deserted
And everyone leaves you on hold
When none of your friends seem to care what you're doin'
And you're feeling old, out in the cold
When the only thing left of romance is a memory
And your memory's not strong
Whenever your clouds lose their silvery lining
I'll keep you warm, out of the storm
You don't need no psychiatry
Come on baby you can talk to me
Cuddle up on the couch with me
We can talk all night for free
You don't need to be hypnotized
Lay down here and look me in my eyes
Cuddle up on the couch with me
We can talk all night for free
Won't you talk to me
Come on and talk to me
Oh talk to me
When you're feeling the blues and there's no one to lean on
When nobody makes you belong
You need to be safe in the arms of a someone
Who'll make you strong, it won't take long
If you're lookin' for someone that you can believe in
Let that someone be me
Can't think of a thing that some lovin' can't handle
Let's make a start, give me your heart
You don't need no psychiatry
Come on baby you can talk to me
Cuddle up on the couch with me
We can talk all night for free
You don't need to be hypnotized
Lay down here and look me in my eyes
Cuddle up on the couch with me
We can talk all night for free
Talk to me
Oh won't you talk to me
Oh, keep on talking to me
You gotta, you gotta talk to me
We, could be the last two on earth
To start a new world
Just you and me, girl
Try, and you can almost see
How it could be, just you and me
Lost, trapped in the freezing cold
Barely alive, have to make love to survive
I'll show you how it's done
We'll take it as it comes
A rocket to the sun
I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long
Forgot what I'm waiting for
Stranded on a desert isle
With no one around
For thousand of miles
Imagine any place
This is what it takes
But don't tell me to wait
I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long
Forgot what I'm waiting for
I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long
Forgot what I'm waiting for
Forgot what I'm waiting for, whoa
I don't want to wait anymore
I just don't think I have the strength
The strength to carry on
Oh, I don't want to wait anymore
I waited so long
Forgot what I'm waiting for

Smokey, Smokey

Throughout my lifetimes, I'd hesitate
I'd feel some joy
But before I'd show my thanks
It became too late, ooh
But now all the way
I want to find the time and stop to say
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us each new day

And thinking back over so many years
Love that's filled my ears
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us pure Smokey, ooh ooh
And anyone who hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure Smokey, pure Smokey
Smokey, pure Smokey

(Thank you Lord)

He's singing it so sweetly like no one else could do
Always trying something new
And I thank you Lord
For giving us pure Smokey
And anyone who hears, hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure Smokey, Smokey
Ooh ooh

Thank you Lord

Is everything all right?
I just called to say how lost I feel without you
Miles away
I really can't believe I'm here and how I still care about you

Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Is everything the same?
Do you ever think of me and how we loved one another?
Will you change your mind?
Will you want me back again or have you found yourself a new lover?

Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Is everything okay?
I just thought I'd write a song to tell the world how I miss you
'Cause each and every day
I think of all the words I never said and all the chances that I had to

Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be

Is everything all right?
There you have it
You see this love regretting
There's something wrong again
But you had it
In the palm of your hand
Your heart has started bleeding
You gotta get out
You're leaving
You're on your own forever
It's not the space or time or whether
You can leave
You want, you can't have
You need, you can't touch
You plead, it's enough, enough
There's something happening to ya
Love can see right through ya
In a world of make believe
Don't go throwing it all away
Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Treat it as a good thing
Be always ready
With that electric feeling
You work so hard
To be in love with her
She tries so hard
You gotta let it go
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
The more and more you hear it
The more it seems to make sense
To hold love in the palm of your hand
But you think that round the corner
They're queuing up to hold her
But that won't make a difference in the end
There's never space or time or whether
You can leave
You want, you can't have
You need, you can't touch
You plead, it's enough, enough
There's something happening to ya
Love can see right through ya
In a world of make believe
Don't go throwing it all away
Hold on to love
There's nothing more important
Treat it as a good thing
Be always ready
With that electric feeling
You work so hard
To be in love with her
She tries so hard
You gotta let it go
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
You work so hard
To be in love with her
She tries so hard
You gotta let it go
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on to love
There's nothing more important
Hold on to love
Don't let it pass you by
Hold on to love
There's nothing so important
Hold it in the palm of your had
Yeah, yeah
Hold on to love
There's nothing more important
Hold on to love
Don't ever let it pass you by
Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Treat it as a good thing
Treat it as a good thing
Treat it as a good, good thing

As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooh, we got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I've got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
I found a lover with a slow hand
Ooh, a lover with a slow hand

And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush
Ooh, lover with a slow hand

She's simply awesome
Ooh

She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run


Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

She is the queen
My Caribbean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans...
You take me through so many moods
Midnight excitement to the quiet interludes
And just when I think I've got a clue
I see something new that I have never seen in you
With your eyes you ask what´s in my heart
You wonder why I love you
I don't know where to start
'Cause no one emotion could ever reveal
All the things that I feel
No one emotion would ever do
No one emotion could ever describe
'Cause there's too many here inside
I wish I knew the one thing it was
It's more like a thousand things
That all add up to love
Sometimes I look when you don't see
And a wave of affection comes a-washing over me
With your eyes you ask what's in my heart
You wonder why I love you
I don't know where to start
No one emotion could ever reveal
All the things that I feel
No one emotion would ever do
No one emotion could ever describe
All the feelings inside
No one emotion would be enough
I might as well try to paint with just one stroke
Or try to write a love song with just a single note
'Cause no one emotion could ever reveal
All the things that I feel
No one emotion would ever do
No one emotion could ever describe all the feelings inside
No one emotion would be enough
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Oh, round, an' round, an' round, an' round, an' round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

I have to come and see you
Maybe once or twice a year
I think nothing would suit me better right now
Than some downtown atmosphere
In the dance halls and the galleries
Or betting in the OTB
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

The sun goes down in Jersey
Rises over Little Italy
We could talk it up till the block gets up
Swapping stories
Sitting around in some all night zoo
Watching it run like a movie
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

But now it's cloak and dagger
Walk on eggshells and analyze
Every particle of difference
Gets like mountains in our eyes
You say, "You're unscrupulous!"
You say, "You're naïve!"
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

Sometimes change comes at you
Like a broadside accident
There is chaos to the order
Random things you can't prevent
There could be trouble around the corner
There could be beauty down the street
Synchronized like magic
Good friends, you and me

No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel
No nerves of steel, no hearts of gold
No blame for what we can and can't control

Good friends, you and me
Good friends, you and me

A couple of days isn't a very long time
Why can't I just walk away
I used to be good at goodbye
But out on the water
Under the stars
I let the moonlight play a trick on my heart

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

The radio plays, the sound of the waves rollin' in
The smell of the night
Sure can get under your skin
Just for a moment
I held you too close
Now I'm all out of time, and I don't wanna let go

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

How much can happen in a night or two?
I guess it's all depending on your point of view

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

You had some fun for the weekend
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life
You took me out to the deep end
And I fell right over
I didn't think twice
I finally got something worth keepin'
And if I can't have you tonight
At least I had the weekend

I can tell you got plans for me
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully
But tonight
I have to say
There just might be another way
(I can't wait to)
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms?
I can't wait
I can't wait

I'm the one you want
That's all I wanna be
So come on baby, make a move on me
Got nowhere to go
All my time is free
So come on baby, make a move on me
Tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait

You made the prettiest speech I've heard
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words
To a heart that's open wide
And from the start was on your side
(I can't wait to)
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms?
I can't wait
I can't wait

I'm the one you want
That's all I wanna be
So come on baby, make a move on me
Got nowhere to go
All my time is free
So come on baby, make a move on me
Tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait
I'm the one you want
That's all I wanna be
So come on baby, make a move on me
Got nowhere to go
All my time is free
So come on baby, make a move on me
Tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait
I've been writing letters everyday now
Since you've been gone
Talking to you on the telephone
For what seems like a whole life long
I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
I'm bringing it to you personally, personally, personally yeah, yeah
I'm bringing it to you personally, personally, personally yeah, yeah
There's nothing like the feeling I get
Oh when you touching me baby
There's nothing like the feeling you get
When I'm there with you, oh love
I've got something that the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest friend
I'm bringing it to you personally, personally, personally yeah, yeah
I'm bringing it to you personally, personally, personally yeah, yeah
But I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest friend
I'm bringing it to you personally, personally, personally yeah, yeah
I'm bringing it to you personally, personally, personally yeah, yeah

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town,
 Lido put the money down and let it roll
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road
Lido be runnin',
 havin' great big fun, until he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow
and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline,
headin' for the borderline
Goin' for broke
Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint ain't nothin to it
One more for the road
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
One more job ought to get it
One last shot and we quit it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh...
Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away
Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today?
Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done?
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep)
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooo
Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess your leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now, you wanna be free
Well, I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
And don't come crying to me
When you're the lonely one
Remember what you've done
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooohooo
We don't talk
But I ain't losing sleep, no
I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho
We don't talk
Ahaha, we don't talk

Oh!
Yeah

Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Yes, I will
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind

There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new
Oh!

Eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
You and I
We're a deadly combination

So don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see

Pamela,
 don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Yeah, I love you, little girl...
Oh!

Black and white always go together
Day and night, you're the precious jewel I treasure

Wanting every part of you is not a crime
Could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time?

Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
All, yeah!



Oh, Pamela (Oh, Pamela)
Thousands of miles away, but always in my heart

Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
It all behind!


If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
Now you're gone, I'm really not the same
I guess I held myself to blame
Time can erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's sad

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now

Now that I'm alone it gives me time
To think about the years that you were mine
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found - 
Listen to me, baby
You know I can't hold you back now


You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now

I still hang around neither lost nor found
Hear the lonely sound of music in the night
Nights are always bright
That's all that's left for me, yeah

I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life
It's the only life I know
Street life
And there's a thousand cards to play
Street life
Until you play your life away

You let the people see
Just who you wanna be
And every night you shine
Just like a superstar
The type of life that's played
A temptin' masquerade
You dress you walk, you talk
You're who you think you are

Street life
You can run away from time
Street life
For a nickel, for a dime
Street life
But you better not get old
Street life
Or you're gonna feel the cold

There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon

Street life, street life, street life, oh street life
Hmm, Yeah, oh

I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life
It's the only life I know
Street life
There's a thousand cards to play
Street life
Until you play your life away
Oh !

Street life, street life, street life, oh street life...
I can't imagine why you say the things you do
Maybe in time I'll understand
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel
When I'm trying everything I can
My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way
Can you hear me?
Am I really coming through?
Why do your eyes seem to dance away?
I know what's right for you, haven't I always?
I need you more than I can say
My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way
My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way
And I'll never ever change
In my lifetime, I'll stay the same
Yes, I'll never, I'll never change
I'll love you, I'll stay the same
My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
Fire burning bright, and it keeps on growing
Keeps on growing
The many times you've learned the lines
That love has spoken
So easily you love to leave
Your heart's unbroken
You've opened up a hundred eyes
And given them a point of view
Now think about the times you knew
And hold them up to me and you
Love has come of age
You close your eyes and
Fantasize a lost horizon
A memory, a gentle breeze for love
To ride in
But in your dreams you turned arouind
And stumbled on a Shangri-la
You'll never be along anymore
'Cause brother now you've gone too far
Love has come of age
I'll stop by by tomorrow
I'll stop by by tonight
I'll stop by by morning. Momma
It's alright
If a gigolo's what you're after
You'll have to hold on tight
Bye bye bye, later, baby
Make it, make it right

If you want it
You can get it
With your love
If you want it
You can get it
With your love

I had a feeling that I met you
Some place before
I had a feeling that I wanted you
Deep inside my soul (Oh, woah)
When I saw your face just smiling back at me
I knew no other could ever take your place
If I want you to be part of my life
I gotta just wait, as long as it takes

If you want it (Oh, if you want it, baby)
You can get it
With your love (Say wit' your love, yeah)
If you want it (If you want it)
You can get it (You can get it)
With your love (All you gotta do)
If you want it
You can get it (Oh, pretty baby)
With your love (With your love, with your love)
If you want it (Girl, if you want it)
You can get it (You can get it)
With your love

No matter how much time it takes you
To feel my love
I got a feeling that you'll want me too
Beside your soul, whoa
When you feel this way, if you think it's just a game
Don't be affected by the things that people say
Just try to believe the magic of fate
You gotta just wait, as long as it takes

If you want it
You can get it (Say, just believe)
With your love (In the magic of fate)
If you want it (Anything that you want, baby)
You can get it (You can get it)
With your love (Oh, with your love, with your love, with your love)
If you want it (If you want it)
You can get it (you can have it, you can get it)
With your love (Oh, whoa)
If you want it (Just take your time, baby)
You can get it (You can get everything)
With your love (With your love I say hey, hey)
If you want it (Girl, if you want it)
You can get it (Oh)
With your love (With your love, with your love)
(I say with your love)
If you want it (Oh, whoa)
You can get it (You can get it)
With your love
If you want it (Ooh)
You can get it (Just take the time)
With your love (To just believe, in me)
If you want it (Oh, whoa)
You can get it (You can get it)
With your love
If you want it you can get it

It's easy to love when I love someone like you
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do

You know love don't come easy and love don't come fast
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last
On the day that I met you, I knew it could be
So easy for you and so easy for me

It's easy to love when I love someone like you babe
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do babe

Like the stars in the night seem to shine from above
But that's the way I love to shine when you give me your love
And your love satisfies me like a natural high
From the soles of my feet to the top of the sky

It's easy to love when I love someone like you
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do

You know love don't come easy, and love don't come fast
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last
On the day that I met you, I knew it would be
So easy for you and so easy for me

It's easy to love when I love someone like you babe
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do babe
It's easy to love when I love someone like you babe
It's easy to love, it's easy to love
Yeah so easy to love, yeah so easy to love
Yeah so easy to love
I never won for losing
But it ceased to be amusing when you told me
That ev'ry night you're shining bright
And the big apple band a callin' out your name
And what do you mean the Rolling Stones ain't nothing to you
'Cause they ain't got the beat right
I'm trying to tell you something
But you're gonna jump around crazy half the night
Ev'rybody be dancing, dancing
Dancing half the night away
Ev'rybody be dancing
Dancing half the night away
Say you like to have a good time
But you don't want to go no place cold and old
You're heading for the neon light
To join the crowd shaking from door to door
You get me in such a heat
You know I'm gonna catch that beat if it kills me
But don't you think it's a crying shame
That they don't dance like Carmen here no more
Ev'rybody be dancing, dancing
Dancing half the night away
Ev'rybody be dancing
Dancing half the night away
Falling, oh, oh, I'm falling
Falling so deep in love with you
But you say that
Only a fool could fall in love
With a girl like you
If that's the truth
What have I got to lose
And I wonder who, I wonder who
Who will be the next fool be
Will it be me
I wonder who
Can you tell me please
Who will the next fool be
Could it be me
Lonely, I'm so lonely
Maybe, maybe you're lonely too
So don't spend your time
Just sitting around
Wondering who will he be
Who will the next fool be
Let it me
I'm the one you need
Can you tell me please
Who will the next fool be
Let it be me
I don't mind
Falling, oh, oh, I'm falling
Falling, what can I do
Thinking a girl like you
Could fall for a fool like me
Who will the next fool be
Could it be me
I wonder who
Can you tell me please
Who will the next fool be
Could it be me
Can you tell me please
When you make up your mind
Who will the next fool be
Let it be me
Oh I need to know
I need to know
Who will the fool be
Will it be me
Oh, who will the next fool be
Who will the next fool be
Will you tell me please
I need to know
Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights
At Nervous Time
We roll downtown
We've got scenes to crash
We're gonna trick and trash
We're gonna find some fun
We hit the street
With visors down
With our thermasuits
Sealed up tight
We can beat the freeze
And get saved tonight
Let's stop off at the Metroplex
That little dancer's got some style
Yes she's the one I'll be waiting for
At the stage door
Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights
We take the tube
To Club Hi Ho
It's about deadspace
It's a marketplace
And a party house too
Something new
From Charlie Tokyo
It's a kind of pyramid
With a human heart
Beating in an ion grid
A critic grabs us
And says without a smile
The work seduces us with light
Eviva laughs and we step out
Into the blue-white night
Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights
We sail our icecats on the frozen river
Some loser fires off a flare, amen
For seven seconds it's like Christmas day
And then it's dark again
And then it's dark again
Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights
Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights

Take the cable car to Jackson
It's a Friday night affair
Madam Rose's legendary honeycomb
With an ounce of intuition
You can feel it in the air
This working boy has found a place to roam
As some familiar faces
Watch every move you make
And the midnight gangs are snaking through the alleyway
Where they used to play

Down in Chinatown (woah-oh-woah-oh)
Where the nights are always longer than the days
Down in Chinatown (woah-oh-woah-oh)
With the dragon eyes that overlook the bay
Hey, yeah

There's a lair below the city
Where the bottom dwellers go
Trying to find that thrill they've never known
A woman bores the absinthe
As the paper lanterns glow
I think Ms. Jones is better left alone
The corridors are endless
It's not hard to lose your way
Where old men smoke and gamble into Saturday
Do you want to play?


If the California street line
Is the only way you know
You might want to play it safe
Down on Grant Avenue
Where he waits for you

In the moment I first saw you
I could swear that we had met
The look in your eye
Was so familiar
Where and when, I forget
Whispered your name in introduction
Darling, my heart filled the room
And I knew it was you, come back in my life
So we meet again, my long lost friend
Once again, we get to start anew
And it feels like a thousand years
I've been loving you
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near
Searchin' the world for a friend
Come on in, I've been expecting you
Sweet reunion, welcome home again
How many lifetimes have I loved you
How many times have you loved me
The sound of your voice is in my memory
Like the wind, on the sea
The glow of your heart has been my lighthouse
I've followed it in from distant shores
Now I won't be afraid to love anymore
So we meet again, my long lost friend
Once again, we get to start anew
And it feels like a thousand years
I've been loving you
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near
Searchin' the world for a friend
Come on in, I've been expecting you
Sweet reunion, welcome home again
Whatever happens, nothing's ever going to be the same
Now you'll find me here at last
Your love's released me from the past
My heart and soul have always remembered your name
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near
Searchin' the world for a friend
Come on in, I've been expecting you
Sweet reunion, welcome home again
I've always been loving you
Girl have you been waiting here, for someone near
Searchin' the world for a friend
Come on in, I've been expecting you
Sweet reunion, welcome home again

You got the power to turn on my light
When the rest of the world is in darkness
You give me feelings no man could deny
Girl there's something bewitching in you
I need you here by me every night and day
There ain't no words describin' the magic you make

So baby lite me up with your love
Only you can make my temperature rise
We got to give it all that we got
Make those wildest fantasies fly
Come on and lite me up with your love
Won't you lead me to that heaven I need
'Cause girl you know I can't get enough
Lady lay that sweetness on me

You got a motion that melts up my mind
Every time that I see it in action (movin' so good)
There ain't no potion a doc could prescribe
That would stop me reactin' to you
I'm gonna feed your passion with all of my soul
I need to hold you tight girl until I get old

So baby lite me up with your love
Only you can make my temperature rise
We got to give it all that we got
Make those wildest fantasies fly
Come on and lite me up with your love
Won't you lead me to that heaven I need
'Cause girl you know I can't get enough
Lady lay that sweetness on me

Don't need no dreams 'cause a dream won't get it
Want your sugar today
Ain't gonna stop 'cause my heart won't let it
Now and ever after gonna love this life away (love this life away)

You are the answer to every desire
Got me runnin' so hot that I'm steamin' (makin' me fry)
There ain't no question I'm feelin' the fire
'Cause this motor's been burnin' for you
I'm gonna feed your passion with all of my soul
Tonight I'll turn you on till we're out of control
[Final chorus: lead vocal, 
chorus
female backgrounds
So baby 
lite me up with your love
Just lite me up, give me your love
Just lite me up, give me your love
Give it all that we got
Give it to me, all that you got
Give it to me, all that you got
Lite me up with your love
Just lite me up, give me your love
Won't you lead me to that heaven I need
Just lite me up, give me your love
'Cause girl you 
know I can't get enough
Just lite me up, can't get enough
Lady lay that sweetness on me
Just lite me up, can't get enough

You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?


I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love got to do ooh , got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love?
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?
Oh you say you're mine
And I believe you every single time
Even though they say you're not my kind
I just can't believe you'd lie
Oh all my friends are laughing
Seeing you out with other men i'm dying
Can't you see it in my eyes i'm cryin
I just can't believe you're not mine
Would you hurt the man who loves you
Would you hurt the man today
Would you take the love you gave me away
Would you hurt the man who loves you
Would you hurt the man today
Would you take the love you gave me away
Oh what have I done
All the time I guess it was just fun
I gave away this Sweetest girl I knew
Oh, just for you
Would you hurt the man who loves you
Would you hurt the man today
Would you take the love you gave me away
Would you hurt the man who loves you
Would you hurt the man today
Would you take the love you gave me away
Oh i know
I'll never never never know the truth
Oh I love you too much girl to spoil your fun
I can't run
No no no
I can't run
I guess I had it coming
I fooled around before when I was tied
And now my freedom stings me I couldn't hide
But I'd still be a fool all my life
Would you hurt the man who loves you
Would you hurt the man today
Would you take the love you gave me away
Would you hurt the man who loves you
Would you hurt the man today
Would you take the love you gave me away
Hurt the love you gave me
Hurt the man who loves you
Hurt the love you gave me
Hurt the man who loves you
Hurt the love you gave me
Hurt the man who loves you
Hurt the love you gave me
Hurt hurt
Hurt hurt
Hurt hurt
Hurt hurt.. (repeat til fades)
Close!
As close as any lovers can be
When I feel your magic holding me
You make the love inside me flow
Baby (Baby) There's just something that I want you to know
That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be
Oh-oh it's easy love
You know it's something like I felt before
A way you keep me coming back for more
When you making easy love to me
Touch!
Your touch can make me feel so high
With you the night just seems to fly
You take my every breath away
Oh-Oh-oh, Baby.(Baby)oh what more than is there to say
To say...
That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be
Oh-oh it's easy love
You know it's something like I felt before
The way you keep me coming back for more
When you making easy love to me
That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be
That it's so easy love
When I got you in my arms this way
Oh it's heaven when I hear you say
In your heart is where I'll always be
Oh! Oh! It's easy love
You know it's something like I felt before
The way you keep me coming back for more
When you make easy love to me
I can't imagine how you'd thrill me
And then you'd walk away
I can't imagine how you'd love me
And then you'd go away
Oh, but oh,oh, magic is there when you smile
Just like a Hollywood child
And I haven't noticed just where you've been, like a stranger, like in a wind
I could tell you were a fast-as-ya-can-man
And good advice I could give to you
I wanna see you now
I don't care, I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't cry
No, no, we're two of a kind
Oh,no
Tell me control
It's too much time
I been tryin' to see ya baby, I been dyin' to keenovay
I been tryin' to see ya baby, any way that I can
I been tryin' to see ya baby, I been dyin' to keenovay
I been tryin' to see ya baby and I wonder why
But oh, magic is there when you smile
Just like a Hollywood child
And I haven't noticed just where you've been, like a stranger
Like in my heart I could tell
You were a fast-as-ya-can-man
And good advice I could give to you
I wanna see you now
I don't care, I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't cry
We're two of a kind
Oh, no
Tell me it's not so
It's too much time
I can't imagine how you'd love me
And then you'd run away
I'm over my head, I can't believe it
I can't imagine how you'd love me
And then go away
Oh, but oh
Da da da da da da da da da...
I just have to say
Modern man was meant to win
Lovin' you is all I want
I can taste, I can feel...no, no
Guess love's real
That's what they say now
Undiscovered consciousness they call love
I said less than this, less than this: goodbye
It's too much time

Whenever I see your smiling face
I have to smile myself
Because I love you (Yes, I do)
And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby (I don't know)

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It will grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

I thought I was in love
A couple of times before
With the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you
And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Sent down to break my heart

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
It will grow stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that, tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today, no no darling
No no, darling, no no, yeah yeah
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today

Sometimes a love won't let go
Hard as I try I know it shows
Everybody's telling me
You'll be over her eventually
But how am I supposed to feel so secure?

When I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes somehow
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now

The letter started with goodbye
I've read it half a million times
Tell me this is just a dream
When I wake up she'll be here next to me
Tell me it will be just the way it was, oh

Well, I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now


Who's holding Donna now
I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Who's holding Donna now
(Oh, Donna)
What magic can be found
To make me the one
Who's holding Donna now
(I can't get Donna off my mind)
Who's holding Donna now
I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
L.A. nights ain't for sleeping
Carmel sights are for my fantasies
Redwoods reaching for the sky
And the Golden Gate lights are calling me
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
Western days are so easy
Pacific waves take me mind away
When the sun sets on the ocean
This is where I know I'm gonna stay
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
California 1
California 1

When I first saw you
You were sunshine
You were a smile
That made rainbows
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home
You're a real fine lady
I know you know it too
You wanna be with me
And I wanna be with you
So why don't we get together
'Cause who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
And I ain't fooling you
Give me a chance
And I'll show you, baby
One little chance
Just to hold you
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home
We'll have a good time, lady
Just you wait and see
I'm gonna fall for you
I hope you're gonna fall for me
And after a night together
I know you will agree
I know you will stay
For eternity
Yeah, you were sunshine
You were a smile
That made rainbows
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me
You'll never have to roam
My house would be your home
(My house would be your home)
You'd never have to roam
(You'd never have to roam)
Yeah, yeah
Give me a chance
And I'll show you
One little chance
Just to hold you
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Come with me

You'll never have to roam
Sad eyes, sad eyes, we're going home
You were a smile
That made rainbows
When I first saw you
Right then I knew
Sad eyes, oh, sad eyes
Sad eyes, take you home
Sad eyes, let me take you home
Sad eyes, you'll never have to roam
Sad eyes
Take the short way home
You've been makin' up your mind
And I can save you from the trouble that your heart is goin' through
And I can tell you what your future's gonna be
Maybe we can open up your eyes
Baby, you can't leave me now
There is lightening in the city
Stranger than you ever saw
Get back to your special lover
And I won't ever turn on you
Or tell you you should tell me where you go
Take the short way home
Baby, take care of your health
In this world of evil
I can't keep you to myself
Take the short way home
You'll be safe here by my side
In this world of evil
I can't keep you satisfied
And you can make it easy on yourself
Some other love will call my name when you're away and I'll be gone
And there's no other who could love you more
I keep talkin' to myself when I'm alone
I don't wanna be alone
Crazy people in the shadows
Love is only what you find
Come back here and you'll discover
There ain't nothin' you've been searchin' for
I could not give you now if you are gone
Take the short way home (Home)
Baby, take care of your health
In this world of evil
I can't keep you to myself
Take the short way home
You'll be safe here by my side
In this world of evil
I can't keep you satisfied
Crazy people in the shadows
Love is only what you find
Come back here and you'll discover
There ain't nothin' you've been searchin' for
I could not give you now if you are gone
Take the short way home (Take the short way home)
Baby, take care of your health (Take care of your health)
In this world of evil
I can't keep you to myself (Hey, hey)
Take the short way home (The short way home)
You'll be safe here by my side (Be safe here by my side)
In this world of evil (Yeah) I can't keep you satisfied (Can't keep you satisfied)
Take the short way home (Take the short way home)
Baby, take care of your health (Take care of your health)
In this world of evil (Oh)
I can't keep you to myself
Take the short way home
You'll be safe here by my side (Right by my side)
In this world of evil
I can't keep you satisfied (Yeah, yeah)
Take the short way home (Home)
Baby, take care of your health (Oh, yeah)
In this world of evil
I can't keep you to myself
Take the short way home

Hoo!
Hee!

Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearnin'
I promised I would never ever be returnin'
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearnin', hee, hee!
As we walked into the room, there were faces
Starin', glarin', tearin' through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scarin' me

We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sittin' in my room
She walked up to my face, and said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon (Boo!)

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other, hee, hee!
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's trial thought in beguile
This is scarin' me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scarin' me

We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through (Boo!)

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago on today (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)

Hoo!

Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago on today (Heartbreak Hotel)
Hurtin' my mind, hoo! (Heartbreak Hotel)
You break my baby’s heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel (Heartbreak Hotel)
Just welcome to the scene, hoo!
No, oh I

Straight outta school but still just a fool
Thought the streets were paved with gold
He moved off the block and found he was lost
In a world he'd never known
He had to hustle so he could pay the rent
Played all the aces and wound up president

You see it's okay (Baby)
Got to find your own way
(Hold your dream real tight)
Keep on tryin' all day
(Some days are hard)
And you know your time will come
You'll get your chance to run

You're livin' in America
You're livin' in the home of the dream
You're livin' in America
Just make it what you want it to be

Soap opera child with hope in her eyes
Looking for a starring role
She came into town and acted the clown
Had a long, long way to go
Waiting on tables and pumpin' gasoline
She served an agent, now she's a movie queen

You see it's okay
(It's all okay)
Got to find your own way
(Hold on to your dream)
Keep on tryin' all day
(Sometimes it's hard)
And you know the time will come
For each and everyone

You're livin' in America
You're livin' in the home of the dream
Don't be afraid
You're livin' in America
Just make it what you want it to be

You'll stand alone on a long hard road
With a crowd that you can't see
Just start by steppin' out
Then let your mind run free

You're livin' in America
You're livin' in the home of the dream
You're livin' in America
Just make it what you want it to be

You're livin' in America
(Come on now)
You're livin' in the home of the dream
(Put your hands together, let's say it real loud)
You're livin' in America
(A country of the people, for the people, and by the people)
Just make it what you want it to be
(Let me hear everybody sing it loud and clear, let's go)
You're livin' in America
(I know you believe it)
You're livin' in the home of the dream
(So don't you be afraid)
You're livin' in America
(Come on, everyone)
Just make it what you want it to be
(I love you, America)
You're livin' in America
(And all the big cities across the country, let's sing it for 'em)
You're livin' in the home of the dream
(So don't you be afraid, no, no)
You're livin' in America
(Sing it for me, children)
Just make it what you want it to be
(Don't you be afraid)
You're livin' in America
(Put your hands together — you got it)
You're livin' in the home of the dream
(Come on, come on out there in L.A.)
You're livin' in America
(Come on in Georgia, Idaho, Wyoming)
You're livin' in the home of the dream
(Texas, Massachusetts, Connecticut)
You're livin' in America
(New York, come on, everybody, Alabama)
You're livin' in the home of the dream
(Let's say it now, Washington, D.C.)
You're livin' in America

Down in Jamaica
They got lots of pretty women
Steal your money
Then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with ol' Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan

On and on
She just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying
On and on, On and on, On and on

Poor ol' Jimmy
Sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder
Steals the stars from the sky
Puts on Sinatra and starts to cry

On and on
He just keeps on trying
And he smiles when he feels like crying
On and on, On and on, On and on

When the first time is the last time
It can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight
Don't let her say goodnight

Got the sun on my shoulders
And my toes in the sand
Woman's left me for some other man
Aw, but I don't care
I'll just dream and stay tan
Toss up my heart and see where it lands

On and on
I just keep on trying
And I smile when I feel like dying
On and on
On and on
On and on

On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
Ooh, yeah
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Sha la la la la la, my lady
In the sun with your hair undone
Can you hear me now
Callin' your name from across the bay?
A summer's day laughin' and a-hidin'
Chasin' love out on Thunder Island
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
She was the color of the Indian summer
And we shared the hours without number
Until one day when the sky turned dark
And the winds grew wild
Caught by the rain and blinded by the lightning
We rode the storm out there on Thunder Island
I held her close
Until the storm passed
And we fell down laughing in the wet grass
Both our bodies drying in the sunshine
Sweet sunshine
So, sha la la la la la, my lady
In the sun with your dress undone
Now every mile away and every day
Cuts a little bit deeper
I'll remember the nights in the cool sand
Makin' love out on Thunder Island
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
Goodbye, Thunder Island
(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

I see you, you see me
Watch you blowing the lines when you're making a scene
Oh, girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks the senses will show
To my heart, when it's watching for lies
You can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you, watching you, watching you, watching you

You play with words, you play with love
You can twist it around, baby, that ain't enough
'Cause girl, I'm gonna know
If you're letting me in or letting me go
Don't lie when you're hurting inside
'Cause you can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move, baby
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you, watching you, watching you, watching you


Ooh, why you try to put up a front for me?
I'm a spy but on your side, you see
Slip on into any disguise
I'll still know you, look into my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Oh babe, private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you

Private eyes
They're watching you, yeah
They see your every move, they see it
Private eyes, oh

Private eyes
They're watching you

Private eyes, ooh
Watching you, yeah
They see your every move, they see you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Your private eyes
They're watching you

Private eyes
Watching you
They watch your every move, girl
Every move
Oh I see you, oh I see you
Private eyes
Private, private, private eyes, girl
Watching you
Eyes
They're watching you, watching you

Private eyes
Watching you
Every move
They see your private eyes, yeah
Watching you
I was lost ... in time
Feelin' like the victim of a perfect crime
Until that night ... I met you
How was I to know just what your love could do
Now I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see
I believe in you and me
In the dark ... of night
We can be what we would like to be, and it's all right
When it's you ... you and me girl
Well I feel like we're the only people in the world
I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, It's so easy, so damn easy
To see
The way I feel for you
And you ... for me
Now I believe
There has been a change in me
Yeah, I believe
That it was meant to be
Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, Can't you see
I believe in you and me
Oh, Can't you see...
A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding, the ring, the whole dumb thing
I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got
"I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through"
And I said, "Baby, let's go get married
Well, I need to know you're mine
I am hangin' on, I am hangin' on
I am hangin' on this line
And if I can leave one message
Before you go to bed
I would say to you..."
And the phone went dead
So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat
Of course she called about three minutes after that
Would she be my wife and share my life?
Well, of course you can write the plot
'Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got
"I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through"
And she said, "Baby, I got your message
Well, I'm answering your call
I have thought it out, I have thought it out
And I think that all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time
Then my answer is..."
And the phone went
"I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine"
The sun just went behind a cloud again
Down crowded streets he walks alone
He's a stranger out of place
A number not a face
And all day long, all day long
He's feelin' like an alien
Feelin' like he don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way back home
The feelin' that he feels he can't explain
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, they're all the same
He's lost and all alone
A heart without a home
Standin' like a statue in the rain
He's feelin' like an alien
Feelin' like he don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way back home
Now, now and then we all are aliens
Feelin' like we don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way back home
Feelin' like an alien
He's feelin' like he don't belong
Have mercy, cried the alien
Help him find his way
Help him find his way

I've been thinkin' 'bout you, for quite a while
You're on my mind every day and every night
My every thought is you, the things you do
Seem so satisfying to me, I must confess it, girl

Ooh, and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh, and I like it
Girl, you're blowin' my mind with the things you say to me

I like the way you comb your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care
Like when I'm all alone with you
You know exactly what to do
You put that fire inside of me
And make it more than just a dream

Ooh, and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh, and I like it

You put that fire inside of me (I'm for it, adore it)
And make it more than just a dream (So come let me enjoy it)

Everybody let me be
I was born in Flatland, U.S.A
And all my dreams lead me to L.A
Another case of rags to riches
I learned to throw some fancy pitches
And I found out what ain't, and which is
Just exactly cool
Heaven help the fool
Guess I showed the sons of bitches
Heaven help the fool
Got a place in Malibu
Like you've never seen
Pickin' out your lady friends
From Penthouse magazine
You ought to see the chrome gleam
On my new Mercedes
All shiny and new
Hey, I'm the Jack of Diamonds
The boy with all the clues
Lotta pretty vanity
No not me
Glorified insanity
No not me
I'm a hyper-survivor, fast driver, star-driver
Heaven help the fool
Professional gimme-fiver
Heaven help the fool
Anything you want to be
You can buy, even get it free
Make yourself a smoother dancer
Fill your head with easy answers
Never a backward glancer
It's you who makes the rules
Heaven help the fool
No, never a backward glancer
Heaven help the fool
The middle of a pentagram
Heart of a star (what you are)
You can trade your soul for an electric guitar
Fool, lotta pretty vanity
No, not me
Fool, glorified insanity
No, not me
When they offer golden apples
Are you sure you'll refuse?
Heaven help the fool
Are you sure you'll refuse?
Heaven help the fool
Just like a deaf man dancin'
Like a blind man shootin' pool
Heaven help the fool

I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
I'm under your spell each time that your appear
A kiss so passionate that has me mesmerized
I fall more in love each time that you are near
Star light, star bright
Your love shines near or far just like
The brightest star
Sweet things you do
It sets my heart aglow
And I want you to know

They remind me (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you darling)
Remind me, yeah yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you darling)

Those three little words that mean so much to me
You know how to make my feelings show
We're just like a song in perfect harmony

You remind me, yeah yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)
Hmm-hmm (In love with you darling)
Remind me, yeah yeah (I'm lucky I'm falling)

(Chorus)
Tranquillo, got to get you into bed now
Just a little boy in the body of a dream
Can't stay up and won't go to sleep
What does it mean -
Tranquillo, no other way to go now
'Cause you need a lot of bass &amp; drums for your rockabye
Just a lullaby for a wide-eyed guy
This charm of yours, better put it on hold
Put it on hold, put it on hold because you...
(Chorus)
Melt my heart, why don't you
Melt my heart
Melt my heart, tranquillo
Melt my heart
Tranquillo, I wanted to go out dancin'
But you got me dancin' round and round
Your momma's never gonna get to town
These plans of mine better put 'em on hold
Put 'em on hold, put 'em on hold because you
(Chorus)
Melt my heart, why don't you
Melt my heart
Melt my heart, tranquillo
Melt my heart
I never thought that it would end this way
Somehow it'd always go on
And yet this morning when I reached for her
She was gone, whoa
I never asked for any promises
I knew she'd always be there
I swear somebody must be laughing at me somewhere
Love, love
Somebody took my love, love
How can this be?
She said, "Always be there for me"
Whoa
Love, ooh, love
Somebody took my love, love
Please set her free
You don't know what she means to me
I never saw a single warning sign
When did he capture her heart?
How could I have ever let him break us apart?
Whoa, whoa
I feel so helpless and so out of touch
There's no escaping this pain
Deep down inside, I know
She can't be the one to blame, whoa
Love, love
Somebody took my love, love
How can this be?
(How can this be?)
She said, "Always be there for me"
(Said she'd always be)
Whoa
(Said she'd always be)
Love, ooh, love
Somebody took my love, love
Please set her free
You don't know what she means to me
(What she means to me)
So cold, spending my nights alone
'Til somebody hears me call your name
Won't somebody send her home?
I feel so helpless and so out of touch
There's no escaping this pain
Deep down inside, I know
She can't be the one to blame, whoa
Love, love
Somebody took my love, love
(My love)
How can this be?
(How can this be?)
She said, "Always be there for me"
(That's what she said)
Whoa
Love, ooh, love
Somebody took my love, love
Please set her free
(Please set her free)
You don't know what she means to me
(You don't know what she means to me)
Love, love
Somebody took my love, love
How can this be?
(How can this be?)
She said, "Always be there for me"

For your love
For your love
When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Oooh, I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you, babe
I just wanna stop for your love.  Oooh
For your love
For your love.  (For your lo-o-ove.)
When I think about the way the world must turn
(The world must turn)
I get the saddest thoughts of you and me.  (You and me)
Memories of life and times go on and on
Oooh, I've tried hard to forget it
But alone my mind won't let it
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just wanna stop for your love
Oooh, I've tried so hard to take it
But alone my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop

I just wanna stop for your love
Stop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo
I just wanna stop.  Hoo, hoo, hoo
I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you, babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just wanna stop
Can't understand
Why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
With the silly, silly games we play
We've got our love
And no matter how it's said or done
We are one no matter what we do
We are one our love will see us through
We are one and that's the way it is
We are one
Sometimes I feel
That we try and make each other sad
I don't know why
The things we do
How we make each other feel so bad
We've got so much
We could all be having so much fun
We are one from the very start
We are one deep down in your heart
We are one
And that's the way it is
We are one
I can't understand
Why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
With the silly silly games we play, play
We've got our love, our love
And no matter how it's said or done
We are one
We are one
You can't get away
We are one
We are one
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
We are one
We are one

You must be thinkin' something
But you ain't sayin' nothing
You remember me
I used to be your boyfriend
There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
Why should we ruin the purity
Of the moment?

It's a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
What a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid that I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
I really thought that we were special

Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way?
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me
You must be thinking something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me
I have been here always

It's a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
What a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
I really thought we were special, ohh
We were forever, ahh

It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
I really thought we were special

So special, it's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
Everyone thought we were forever

Hello, yeah, it's been a while
Not much, how about you?
I'm not sure why I called
I guess I really just wanted to talk to you
And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for a while
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

We could go walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV
You see, it really doesn't matter much to me

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I won't ask for promises
So you don't have to lie
We've both played that game before:
Say I love you then say goodbye

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowin' the stars around
Bad timing for love - you caught me on your birthday
I could feel your heart break into a hundred pieces
We were too torn apart, now it seems so senseless
And if we're clever, we'll put it together, it may be forever
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
Down on my luck, you arrived just in time, my angel
Thought you'd given me up, like a rhyme that needs no reason
I want you enough to keep my life untangled
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cos it may be forever
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
I want you enough to keep my life untangled
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cos it may be forever
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
If ever we'll make it, we're gonna make it girl
And I know we can take it, we got to take it, girl
If ever we can make it, we gotta make it
And I know we can take it...
Dark clouds are blowing in the wind
He's crossing your mind again
You've got that sad, sad feeling, from a broken heart
Feeling so close to the end
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
When you find out how good love can be
You're so lost when it sets you free
They say once in your life you find someone that's right
Someone who loves you like me
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
When the moon has forgotten what the night's about
And the stars can't work their places out
Hold me tighter than tight
When the daylight comes it'll be alright
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Just look my way
And I'm ready to go
Oooo-oo-oo, your sweet lovin'
I can't leave it alone
You start my heart to pumpin'
Just walkin' my way
I don't care if I feel like a fool
Ohh, sweet feelin'
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Actin' like a fool
Ohh, sweet feelin'
Got me rockin' and really in love
Well, I know it's always said
That love will break your heart
That ain't so
'Cause I gave my heart to you
And now I know
Ooooo, Sweet feelin'
Got me dancin' on the ceiling
Actin' like a fool
I don't care if I feel like a fool
It's just a, ohh, sweet feelin'
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Actin' like a fool
Ohh, sweet feelin'
Got me rockin' and really in love...

Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinking

Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind

Don't leave false illusion behind
Don't cry, I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind

I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor

I wrest the waters, 
fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor

Caught like a sewer rat, alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail
Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying
Sail on, sail on sailor

Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor

Just to see her
Just to touch her
Just to hold her in my arms again
One more time

If I could feel her warm embrace
See her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place
I've got to see her again

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again

I can't hide it, no
I can't fight it, oh
It's so hard to live without the love
She gave to me
Doesn't she know it?
I tried hard not to show it, oh
Can't I make her realize that she
Really needs me again?

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)

She brightened up my everyday
Made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again

(Just to see her)
I want to see her
(Just to hold her)
Hold her, hold her, hold her
(Just to see her)
See her
(Just to touch her)
Touch her

I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
(Just to see her again)
She brightens up my everyday
Makes me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
(Today)
I've got to see her again
(I've got to see her again)
(Just to see her)
It would, it would, it would
(Just to see her)
Make me feel so good
(Just to see her)
If I, if I could only see her again
(Just to see her again)
(Just to see her)
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
(Just to see her)
Oh, don't you know it's true?
(Just to see her)
If I could only see her again
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late
Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, I went round there
I still don't believe it
He was just leaving
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake

The time has come for us to stop messin' around
Cause don't you know that I like havin' you around
...In my life, oh, baby
So many times I want to hold you, oh, so near
I want to say I love you
Softly in your ear
...Oh, baby, don't keep running

My heart is yearning for your love
Cause my heart is yearning for your love

You can't keep runnin' in and out
Of my life
I need to have you as my lover and my wife
...Oh, baby, be my lover
So many times I need to have you by my side
To be my friend, my lover and my guide
...Oh, baby, don't keep runnin'

My heart is yearning for your love
My heart is yearning for your love
My heart is yearning for you
Let me inside your love
Whoa, my heart is yearning for you
Let me inside your love, your love, your love
Your love
(Keep runnin')
(Keep runnin')
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
Oh, dear
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

Girl, I heard you're seein' him
People say you're in love
And I've seen you along with him
And I just don't think that
He's the one you're thinkin' of, baby
I'm the one for you
Sure 'nuff, baby
I'm the one for you
Hey, you
I'm the one for you
Come on, tell the truth now, baby
Ain't I the one for you
And, girl, I heard you wanna get married
And he's so much better for you than me
But still you don't smile
Like I've seen you smile
When your heart is free
And your mind is right at ease, baby
I'm the one for you
Sure 'nuff for you, baby
I'm the one for you
Hey, you
I'm the one for you
Come on, tell the truth now, baby
Ain't I the one for you
When I look into your eyes
I don't see the love light shining there
Girl, I would not be surprised, oh no
If you think that you are
Gonna use me for your spare now, baby
I'm the one for you
You, baby
I'm the one for you
Hey, you
Say, I'm the one for you
Come on, tell the truth now, baby
Ain't I the one for you
I've seen the guy you've been hangin' 'round
But I know he ain't gettin' down with you
Not like I do
Hey, you can try to play it cool
But I'm the one that you can't fool
No, no, I'm the one for you, baby
Listen, he's got wealth, he's got charm
But I'm the one with loving arms for you
I'm the one for you, hey
I'm the one for you
Nobody but you, baby
I'm the one for you
You, I'm the one for you
Hey, you, I'm the one for you, baby
Come on, tell the truth now, baby
Say I'm the one for you
I'm the one for you, baby...
Missing Lyrics

I'm in the mood to end these empty days
Every night, you stare down romancing
Every time I see your face
Hopeless, colder than ice, with no more flame
I think our love has reached the part of no return
It's so sad when lovers don't see

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

That distant look is all you've got to say
Every time I try to talk to you
Every word is lost in space
Drifting further apart in every way
We've come to be the ones whose love is out of sight
It's so clear that we just don't see

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away

There's no reason for this heartache
To go on and on, when the feeling's gone
I can see now that it's too late
To try and change your mind
No more tears, falling
A look says everything, yeah
Eye to eye
Eye to eye, I see, yeah
Eye to eye to eye, yeah

Eye to eye, a look says everything
Eye to eye, so close, so far away (Far away, yeah, yeah)
Eye to eye, a look says everything (One good look says everything)
Eye to eye, a look says everything (You're getting farther away, yeah)
Eye to eye, so close, so far away (Yeah)
Eye to eye
Every day I sit beside you
On the bus to Madison Avenue
Work in the big gray store
With the revolving doors
You don't even know my name
I guess that I'm to blame
Don't know the right things to say
So I pretend away
That I'm Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine, oh
Won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you
Today I'm done with games (today I'm done with games)
Gonna ask you for your name
Say I've been watching you
I even know what you do
Maybe today I'll tell you (maybe today I'll tell you)
I've found the nerve to sell you
On a guy like me
Who wishes that he could be
Your Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine, oh
Won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you
Right before my eyes you'll say you love me too
Rudolph Valentino
I pull up in my limousine, oh
Won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
And then just like Greta Garbo
You stare like there's no tomorrow
And you'll know what I'm thinking of, ooh

Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh, Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burnin' it up so fast
Searchin' for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh, Jeannie, I will always be your fool

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love, I'm so in love

Easy, ready, willin’, overtime
Where does it stop?
Where do you dare me
To draw the line?
You've got the body
Now you want my soul
Don't even think about it

I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It makes me hurt so bad to see you again
Like needles and pins
People say "you've been making out okay
He's in love don't stand in his way"
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before please love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Hurt so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm begging you please
Oooooh oh oh oh
Come back it hurts so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
I'm begging you please
Oh! No!
Noooooo!

Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what is right for me, yeah
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me
Sorry, Charlie
, for the imposition
I think I got it (got it), I got the strength to carry on, oh yeah
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh, what will be

She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh why, what went wrong?

Get up in the morning, look in the mirror
One less toothbrush hanging in the stand, yeah
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken a toll on me

She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh why, what went wrong?

Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away, yeah
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was (was) to (to) me

She's gone, she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, what went wrong?

She's gone
Oh I, I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I, I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone
Oh I, I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I, I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
...


Like a pot fills the empty cup
I just speak, filling the air
My men, my women
Wanna love you, I love you
Forget about your runaway boy
Don't you worry 'bout your bad breath
My men, my women
Wanna love you, I love you

I sing
Yes I sing
All the songs would be sung
I sing
Yes I sing
All the songs would be sung

They'll ignore you so they don't like you
Because they'd find no lies on your lips
My men, my women
Wanna love you, that's right, I love you

Wishing you could keep your smiles
Forever and ever
Wherever
Wherever

Something's up when something's down
Don't you cry, it's not the worse thing to do
My men, my women
Wanna love you, I love you
Voices turn to be power
Another words turns to be flowers
My men, my women
Wanna to love you, I love you

I sing
Yes I sing
All the songs would be sung
I sing
Yes I sing
All the songs would be sung
I sing
Yes I sing
All the songs would be sung
I sing
Yes I sing
All the songs would be sung

Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
I'd be lying if I said I never got the blues
So pardon me for my disposition
You see, I just can't keep
From wishing that I was celebrating too

I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's got to shine sometime
I got some hope for a bright tomorrow
I know this heart gonna mend just fine

In the corner there's a couple dancing
From the kitchen I can hear 'em laughing
They're playing the same old songs on the radio
I wish I didn't have to sit and listen
And be remindеd of what I'm missing
No I'd rather be lonesomе all alone

I know this night won't last forever
I know the sun's got to shine sometime
I got some hope for a bright tomorrow
I know this heart gonna mend just fine

Suddenly, a strange vibration
From my head to my toes
Filling me with a warm sensation
Somebody's letting me know, yeah

It isn't right to be so downhearted
Telling me that the party started
And I got some celebrating to do

Hey I know this night won't last, can't forever
I know the sun's got to shine sometime
Now I got some hope for a bright, such a bright tomorrow
I know this heart gonna mend just fine

It's just the soul that matters, and I don't know why
You know she's gonna make you cry
You know she's gonna make you cry
She'll have you walk beneath the ladder you were meant to climb
You know she's gonna make you try
You know she's gonna make you try

Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night

It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied
You know she's gonna make you cry
You know she's gonna make you cry
She'll have you wishin' that you had her come, rain or shine
You know she's gonna make you try
Ooh, you know she's gonna make you high

Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night


It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied
You know she's gonna make you cry
You know she's gonna make you cry
She'll have you wishin' that you had her come, rain or shine
You know she's~

Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night


There's a time of the day
When the sun is going down
That's the golden time of day
It's a time that the sun
Turns a gold all around
That's the golden time of day
At the end of the day
When the wind is soft and warm
Ooh, it makes the flowers sway
When the sun settles down
And it takes a lovely form
That's the golden time of day


People let me tell you
There's a time in your life
When you find who you are
That's the golden time of day
And in your mind you will find
You're a bright shining star
Ooh, that's the golden time of day
When you feel deep inside
All the love you're looking for
Don't it make it feel okay, yes
Like the time of the day
When the sun is going down
That's the golden time of day
Ooh, ooh, that's the golden time of day
Oh, oh, oh, that's the golden time of the day
[Outro: Maze, 
Frankie Beverly
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
Ooh, shine, children, shine
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
Feel it, fell it
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
Shine if you believe in love
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
Look above and give your heart, yeah, yeah
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
If you believe in love, shine
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh
Shine, shine your love, shine your love, shine your love
Shining, can't you see it shining, oh oh oh

Ali dances and the audience applauds
Though he's bathed in sweat, he hasn't lost his style
Ali, don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free, woah

Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me

I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be
I'll be

Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see, woah

Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign, woah
She's gonna give the go ahead
The inning isn't over yet for me
For me

I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be, I'll be


Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar
I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me

I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be, I'll be


There ain't no reason why you let me wait
Just give me up and I will go, let's set it straight
Got a right to who I am
And if I don't fit your plan then set me free

But you refuse to set me free
And you deny me of my needs
You have me under lock and key
Just set me free, just set me free

You never cared for what I had to say
It's just because you got to have it all your way
Well, I ain't no superman
If that's what you demand then set me free

Couldn't you please just set me free
You get your fun just hurting me
If this is how it's going to be
Just set me free, just set me free

Now I deserve to be as mad as hell because
I just don't get it
I place myself in your hands to fall
But I'm not quitting, no


Feels like the time we spent was going to waste
Sooner or later it's goodbye, we're gonna say
'Cause you just don't give a damn
So go find some other man and set me free

Just don't refuse to set me free
You can't deny me of my needs
Just turn your head to hear my plea
Just set me free, just set me free

Couldn't you please just set me free
You get your fun just hurting me
If this is how it's going to be
Just set me free, just set me free

Just don't refuse to set me free
You can't deny me of my needs
Just turn your head to hear my plea
Just set me free...
Said the fight to make ends meet
Keeps a man upon his feet
Holding down his job
Trying to show he can't be bought
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
Every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Someone's looking for a lead
In his duty to a king or to a creed
Protecting what he feels is right
Fights against wrong with his life
There is no profit in deceit
Honest men know that
Revenge does not taste sweet
Whether yellow, black or white
Each and every man's the same inside
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
You know that love's the only goal
That could bring a peace to any soul
Hey, and every man's the same
He wants the sunshine in his name
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Mmm, every kinda people
To make what life's about
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
She's so very nice
You should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
What you trying to hide
When you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find
Ah, can't you see it
Don't you think she's feeling the same
Ah, I guarantee it
She's the one that's calling your name
Chorus:
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head
You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love
(She's in love with you, boy!)
I ain't telling tales
Anybody else could repeat the things that I've heard
She's been talking sweet and it's on the street
How that girl's been spreading the word
Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you're scared her love is for real
Repeat first half of the Chorus
You should hear how she talks about you
She is really in love

Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you're scared the love is for real
Repeat Chorus
Talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
(Can't you see?  It's me!  Ooh!  What she said!)
Repeat Chorus and Fade

Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ah ahh

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

And I can't tell you why

When we get crazy, it just ain't right
(Try to keep your head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry, just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you

Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be

And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why


Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

And I can't tell you why
No, no baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Não pode ser qualquer mulher
Tem que ser muito especial
Deve saber transar, amor
Como quem sabe o que quer
Trazer na cor o sol e o mar
Sabendo se mostrar e se guardar
Querendo ser mulher demais
Mas tudo sem perder o jeito de menina
Bonita da cabeça aos pés
Ah, tem que ter os lindos pés!
Tem que ter tudo no lugar
No lugar certo tem que ser
Sabendo usar o que tem
Fazer charminho, sei lá! Pode ser
Não pode ser qualquer mulher
Tem que ser toda só pra mim
Saber que eu gosto de amar
Sem ver a hora de acabar
Trazer na cor o sol, o mar
Sabendo se mostrar e se guardar
Querendo ser mulher demais
Mas tudo sem perder o jeito de menina
Não pode ser qualquer mulher, tem que ser toda só pra mim
Não pode ser qualquer mulher, tem que ser muito especial
Bonita da cabeça aos pés, ah, tem que ter os lindos pés!
Não pode ser qualquer mulher, tem que ser toda só pra mim
(só pra mim)...

A world become one of salads and sun
Only a fool would say that
A boy with a plan, a natural man
Wearing a white Stetson hat

Unhand that gun begone
There's no one to fire upon
If he's holding it high
He's telling a lie

I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that

The man in the street dragging his feet
Don't wanna hear the bad news
Imagine your face there at his place
Standing inside his brown shoes

You do his nine to five
Drag yourself home half alive
And there on the screen
A man with a dream

I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that

Anybody on the street
Has murder in his eyes
You feel no pain
And you're younger than you realize
Only a fool would say that
Only a fool

I heard it was you
Talking 'bout a world where all is free
It just couldn't be
And only a fool would say that

Only a fool would say that
Only a fool would say that

I try to dial her number
But, I get a click every time
[Bridge: Ralph Tresvant + 
Bobby Brown
 + (New Edition)]
Some strange man is on the telephone (The telephone)
He keeps telling me my baby, ain't home (That she's not home)
She ain't got no party line
 (Oh, oh)
Situation blowing my mind
 (Oh, oh)
Oh, I just can't take this anymore

Please operator
See what you can do
I dialed the right number
But I still couldn't get through
Could you just check the line
Just one more time if you can
I'm pretty sure her phone
Wouldn't be answered by no man

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man
Something's wrong with my line
I try to dial her number
But, I get a click every time

Must be a bad connection
I give her my love and affection
I just can't take this no more

This situation blowing my mind (Blowing my mind)
Can't get my baby on the line (On the line)

I tried dialing information (Mr. Telephone Man)
I can't get no cooperation (Mr. Telephone Man)
The system on the phone telling me my baby ain't at home
Ah baby, I just can't take it anymore
Help me out, please Mr. Telephone Man
Help me out, please Mr. Telephone Man
It's a feeling
I don't belong here
But man's on the outside looking in
Wonderin' whose in his old armchair
It's a feeling
You never belonged to me
First you're on the up and up
I only look down and see
Only look down and see
You're fighting me
You knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth
You're keeping from me
It's a feeling
I don't belong here
But man's on the outside looking in
Wonderin' whose in his old armchair
It's a feeling
You never belonged to me
First you're on the up and up
I only look down and see
Only look down and see
You're fighting me
You knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth
You're keeping from me
It's a feeling
It's a feeling
[Verse 1: Bill Champlin, 
with bandmates
She said, Tell me what it's all about
I said, 
"Why, why, why?"
It's just something you could do without
You better 
try, try try
She said, "I can't reach you on the telephone
I can't call you when you're not at home"
You keep saying that you're all alone
That's a lie, lie, lie
[Chorus: Peter Cetera, 
with bandmates
Bad advice
Has me down and undone
Got to try again
To believe in myself
Look at me
I'm alone in the end
Can you see me falling
Falling down?
[Verse 2: Bill Champlin, 
with bandmates
I said, "Mama can you get it straight?"
She said, 
"Why, why, why?"
I wanna tell you that it just can't wait
So let's 
try, try, try
She said, "I don't know where you might have gone
I don't care because you've done me wrong"
You been doing it far too long
So goodbye, bye, bye

[Chorus: Peter Cetera, 
with bandmates
Bad advice
Has me down and undone
Got to try again
To believe in myself
Look at me
I'm alone in the end
Can you see me falling
Falling down?
[Verse 3: Bill Champlin, 
with bandmates
She said, Tell me what it's all about
I said, 
"Why, why, why?"
It's just something you can do without
You better 
try, try, try
I can't reach you on the telephone
I can't call you when you're not at home
You keep saying that you're all alone
That's a lie, lie, lie

Where do we go from here, now that all of the children are growin' up?
And how do we spend our lives if there's no one to lend us a hand?

I don't wanna live here no more, I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life quietly fading away

Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say are not right
If I promised you the moon and the stars, would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

Where do we go from here, now that all of the children have grown up?
And how do we spend our time knowing nobody gives us a damn?

I don't wanna live here no more, I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life quietly fading away

Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say are not right
If I promise you the moon and the stars, would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

Games people play, you take it or you leave it
Things that they say just don't make it right
If I'm telling you the truth right now, do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night
Well, I've heard of heartbreakers but you take the cake
Ladies' man
You could charm the diamonds off a rattlesnake
Ladies' man
Ladies bring it on over when you give 'em the glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole 'em, ladies' man
Well it sure takes a lot of good natured self-control
Ladies' man
When I'm so hot for you and you're so cold, so cold
Ladies' man
Why do you keep on trying to make a man of me?
Couldn't you just love me
Like you love cocaine?
Cocaine head games
Cross my heart, I swear I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks, ladies' man
It's just a straight-ahead feeling I have for you
Nothing slick, ladies' man
I guess you learn to refuse
What you think you can't handle
You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream at the first bad scene
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
How much longer 'til the curtain rises?
First night stage fright always hypnotizes
Leading ladies never think about it
Live without it
Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away
One more heartbeat and you walk the wire
Why wait? Ooh, it's too late to put out the fire
Almost strangers, can you stop deceiving
Start believing
Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away, 'cause baby
Oh, even when you feel you can't go on
Laughing at the rain you fool no one
If you don't wanna lose what you have found
Then don't look down
Changing partners is just substitution
It's no solution
Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
...
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
I see a horseman in the sky
It makes me turn and wonder why
I hear the same old fourteen reasons
Must be the changin' of the seasons
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
I met the girl across the sea
She saved my life and came with me
A tender night of dark persuasion
Could be my first and last occasion
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby
I'll supply the love
Baby, I'll supply the love
Baby, I'll supply the
I'll supply the love
I see the questions in your eyes
Wanna think about it twice
For you find your feelings
Reaching out to me
Two different worlds
Too far apart
Too many stops
Right from the start
That say our love could never be
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
And sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Even when you know
You've got to let it go
Don't let go yet
Sometimes love forgets
We found each other in the dark
We felt our way to where we are
We didn't plan on this
It happened much too fast
And though the odds may be unkind
I'll take my chances - I don't mind
Stranger things have come to pass
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Even when you know
You've got to let it go
Don't let go yet
Sometimes love forgets
So let me hold you
Do you want me to hold you?
I could hold you forever and ever
(It's written in the moonlight)
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Even when you know
You've got to let it go
Don't let go yet
Sometimes love forgets
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
What's right or wrong
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
Where love belongs
Sometimes love forgets
CHORUS:
Lovers cross the raging waters
Lovers walk the burnin' sand
Lovers stop the time in order
To take the moment in their hands
Lovers toss away a kingdom
Lovers abdicate the crown
Lovers fight for love and freedom
Breakin' the chains that hold'em down
You gotta keep on...
Lovin' lovers
You gotta keep on...
Didn't I say
Everyone is frantic the antics
Become bizarre
Every last romantic's been
Banished to some cold star
Never again expire, be tired
And given in
I'm gonna take my lover discover
The promised land
I'll say that
CHORUS:
You gotta keep on...
Lovin' lovers
You gotta keep on...
Touchin' others
You gotta keep on...
Lovin' lovers
You gotta keep on...
Didn't I say
CHORUS:
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I
I might have to move heaven and earth
To prove it to you, baby (Baby)
So we're making love
And you feel the power
And I feel the power
Then there's really nothing we can't do
(You know we could, you know we could)
If we wanted to, baby
(You know we could, you know we could)
We could exist on the stars
It'd be so easy
Now, baby
All we gotta do (Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby)
Is get a little faith in you (Baby, baby)
Oh, I've been so many places
I've seen some things (Yes, I have)
I know love is the answer (Yes, it is)
Keeps holding this world together, yeah
Ain't nothing better
Ain't nothing better (Nothing's better)
And all the answers to our prayers
Hell, it's the same everywheres, baby (Just the same now)
Nothing ever breaks up the heart (Love's a game now)
Only tears give you away (Ain't it a shame now?)
Then you're right where I found ya (Oh, baby)
With my arms around ya (Oh, baby)
O-o-o-o-o-o-oh, baby
Baby, baby
Love is a magic word, ooh, yeah (Baby)
Few ever find in a lifetime
But from that very first look in your eyes
I knew you and I had but one heart (Baby)
Only our bodies were apart (It's making me crazy)
That was so easy (Baby)
So easy (Oh, baby)
I had a taste of the real world (Didn't waste a drop of it)
When I went down on you, girl
Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I
I can hear windmills and rainbows
Whenever you're talkin' to me (Never say never)
I feel like swirling and dancin'
Whenever you're walking with me (Whenever you're walking with me)
You ripple like a river when I touch you (Let me touch you)
When I pluck your body like a string (Show you what I mean)
When I start dancin' inside ya (Oh, baby)
You make me wanna sing (I love you so)
Yeah (I love you so)
Baby (I love you so)
Baby (I love you so)
Baby (I love you so)
Baby (Oh)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
All right (All right)
Baby, we're sure doin' it tonight (Baby, we're sure doin' it)
Every time you come by, let me try (Come on by)
Pretty please with sugar on it
That's how I like it, ooh
I can't even believe it with you
It's like having every dream I ever wanted come true (Dream of a lifetime)
I picked up your vibes
You know, it opened my eyes (Dream of a lifetime)
But I'm still dreamin', yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh)
And you're right where I found ya (Oh, baby)
With my arms around ya (Oh, baby)

I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like
Making good conversation
I gotta handle you just right
You know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie
There's nothing left to talk about
Unless it's horizontally

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

I've been patient, I've been good
Tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard, this holdin' back
You know what I mean
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view
We know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out
The animal in me

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk, ah


Oh, let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get animal, animal
I wanna get animal
Let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk, ah-ah

Let me hear your body talk (Your body talk)
Let me hear your body talk

Sail on down the line
'Bout a half a mile or so
And don't really wanna know
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice you see
Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got
But now you're going

And I don't mind about the
Things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah

Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
All my friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that
A small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking

I gave you my heart and
I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time, yeah

Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good

Sail on
Sail on
Sail on

A dying flame
You're free again
Who could love
And do that to you?
All dressed in black
He won't be coming back
Well, save your tears
You've got years and years

The pains of seventeens
Unreal, they're only dreams
Save your crying for the day

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

Miss Teenage Dream
Such a tragic scene
He knocked your crown
And ran away
First wound of pride
And how you cried and cried
But save your tears
You've got years and years

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

(Fool if you think it's over)
(Fool if you think it's over)

I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day

That may not come
But anyone
Who had to pay
Would laugh at you and say

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

I'll buy your first good wine
Oooh, we'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
Just to admit one mistake
That can be hard to take
I know we've made them fall
But only fools come back for more
Being the fool I am
I figured in all your plans, darling
Your perfumed letters didn't say
That you'd be leaving any day
So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun you took my love and run
But love had just begun
I can't refuse her
But now I know that I'm the fool
Who won your love to lose it all
When you come back, you win again
And I'm not proud to say
I let love slip away
Now I'm the one who's crying
I'm a fool there's no denying
When will my heartache end?
Will my whole life depend on fading memories
You took the game this time with ease
So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun you took my love and run
But love had just begun

Wrapped around each other, trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together, lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies, falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero, and you were my leading lady

We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
Ooo-ooo

Honey, can't you remember? We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender, when you gave me your heart
Please say you will, play it again
'Cause I love you still, baby this can't be the end

We had it all (we had it all)
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid
 (here's lookin' at you, kid)
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo

We had it all (we had it all)
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid
 (here's lookin' at you, kid)
Missing all the things we did 
Pandy Fackler was a working girl
Living alone in another world
Of picket fences and a white façade
Sucking dicks under the Promenade
She was almost in a coma - from doing the Bossa Nova
And the 
Funky Cold Medina
 - man, I wish you coulda seen her
Poor little Pandy is doing the best she can
Eating cotton candy from the garbage can
First to come and the last to go
I met her backstage after the second show
Two lonely people on a summer night
We weren't in love but it was still alright
I held her close and she squeezed me tight - my Pandy!
(solos)
Sometimes
I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful places I've been
My arms around the future
And I can think about the past
My aspirations always exceed
My grasp
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey
Whoa whoa
You've got to grow
Sometimes
Know that you've got to reach
A little bit higher (little bit higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old
Mmm no no no
When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
No no
Well you may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you (come to you)
And say these same words again (yeah again again again yeah yeah yeah)
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow
Sometimes I sit myself down and I say
You got to reach (you got to reach)
A little bit higher (higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul (oh)
And you'll never grow old
Never never never grow old
You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher (a little bit higher)
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow
Gonna find out
You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher (a little bit higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire (hey)
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher (a little bit higher)
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow (you've got to grow you got to grow you got to grow you got to grow)
You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire

You've got me captured, I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture, yes, I know it well
Another page is turned
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are


You can't imagine what your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic greets everyone who reads
Heartbreak in motor drive
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait
I've been waiting to meet you
I know you're out there somewhere
Are you waiting to meet me too?
Every morning I start out
Maybe today
Every night turn my heart out
Maybe tomorrow
When I wander in dreamtime
I feel you come closer
Tell me is it the same with you?
You stand on a cliff overlooking the ocean
Below on the beach
I am caught in slow motion
And there we're face to face
Together again for the first time
Face to face
You're the one I can love for a lifetime
Face to face
I can see that it might take a while
Face to face
To escape from the curve of your smile
All alone in a desert
I follow some footprints
Only hoping they lead to you
Always slightly behind you
Just out of frame
In a hurry to find you
Before the dream ends
There's confusion and hardship
But it never matters
'Cause I'm doing it all for you
And I know as I search these wide open spaces
You wait under a palm tree
At the oasis
Cancel loneliness
Capture happiness
Let that heartache and pain go
Love feels awful good
Like I knew it would
All superlatives true
Never better now
It's forever now
Finally over the rainbow
I was blind I see
Fate was kind to me
When it cast me with you
Hey baby
You don’t care
You don’t share
You won’t make believe
You won’t tell me things
I got to know
I got to know
I want it now
Don’t you understand
When you love somebody
You must look into her eyes
When you love somebody
You have pride
You say you love me but you know it’s a lie
I have to trust you it’s a matter of pride
Hey baby
I just can’t take it
You make me mad
Tell me how you really feel
I want to know bad
When you love somebody
You must look into her eyes
When you love somebody
You have pride
Call me baby, call me on the telephone
Tell me baby, tell me that you want me home
Give me a minute, I’ll be there right away
Tell me baby, are those the right words to say
I got to find out if this love is really real
Don’t kid me baby, I got to know how you feel
I want to wind up in the right place with you
I gotta find out if it’s for me you do what you do
You say you love me but you know it’s a lie
I have to trust you it’s a matter of pride
When you love somebody
You must look into her eyes
It’s a matter of pride
Love somebody
Love's in a memory. Too many faces that I have given
All my life I desired someone who would know me
Time and time again I try to keep on goin' on
But it doesn't always seem to work
I just wanna say that I am waiting always for your love
Could you know?
Lost in a wonderland
Looking for you is a dream of visions
All my life I desired someone who would love me
Time and time again I try to turn myself to me
But it doesn't work
I just miss you more and more
I'm waiting always for your love... Love
Someone said another day is my hesitation now
Come again... I wanna play some more
You're the one. The only one
That's my liberation of love
It's a matter of faction in another kind of world
Of mine
Loving's a mysterious thing, too
Something you can't deny
Someone who puts the flame to... of love inside
Love is an incredible thing you just have to hold to
Love is on the way for those who hope to
Love is an incredible dream yeah... if you just want it
Oh my head
Time and time again I try to turn myself to me
But it doesn't always seem to work
I just miss you more and more
I'm waiting always for your love
Could you know?

Yesterday
I just saw the one you left behind, yesterday
I could tell that he was hurting for you
Sad, but he can't deny it
There was nothing else he could do
He was one of the many struck by it

Hurting for you
Finished before it started
It's the only thing left to do
'Cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for you

Day to day
That's how you should learn to live your life, day to day
Put aside those dreams that keep hurting for you
Don't let the pain remind you
There is nothing else you can do
Better not ever let the day find you

Hurting for you
Finished before it started
It's the only thing left to do
'Cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for you

Sympathy
I don't want to sound like what I feel seems like pity at all
Destiny
But in the great design of life we are all so pitifully small
Yeah


The last of the broken-hearted is
Hurting for you
Sad but I can't deny it
There was nothing else I could do
I was one of the many struck by it
Hurting for you
Don't let the pain remind you
There is nothing else that you can do
Better not ever let the day find you
Hurting for you
Finished before it started
It's the only thing that's left to do
'Cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for you

Last night I let my heart down
I said I'd never go round
Love's crazy world again
I'd stick to games that I could win
I saw him standing so cool
Hops out in search of new fools
I volunteer for heartaches
But here I am, and it's almost daybreak

Somebody please, help me try and get it right tonight
I'm on my knees, nothing makes sense in the morning light

It's just another day now
I know I'll get by somehow
It just don't seem to help
When I wake up near by myself
Day dreamin' just don't get it
But Lord, I can't forget him
I need love, I'm no stranger
Take it slow, 'cause I'm no short-changer

Somebody please, hеlp me try and get it right tonight
I'm on my knees, nothing makes sеnse in the morning light
Somebody please, help me try and get it right tonight
I'm on my knees, nothing makes sense in the morning light
Somebody please, help me try and get it right tonight
I'm on my knees, nothing makes sense in the morning light

Here she comes riding
Rolling it down the line
Slipping and sliding
Taking her sweet old time
And laughing all the way to the parking lot
Knowing in the back of her mind
She's gonna show the boy what she's really got
And stop him in the nick of time

Shake it baby, shake it all you can tonight
Go on and break them baby
Break them all you can tonight
Cause it won't last forever
But do it for worse or for better
And give the boy something to dream on later

Here she comes sliding
Shaking it down the hall
She's got a picture in her locker
An autographed basketball
She's got a purse that was made in Mexico (Mexico)
A mind that was made for love
She's got a new way of dancing slow
She knows what you're thinking of

Shake it baby, shake it all you can tonight
Go on and break them
Break them all you can tonight
Cause it won't last forever
Do it for worse or for better
And give the boy something to dream on later


It won't last forever
Do it for worse or for better
And give the boy something to dream on later

Shake it baby, shake it all you can tonight
Go on and break them baby
Break them all you can tonight
Shake it baby, shake it all you can tonight
Break them baby
Break them all you can tonight
Go on and shake it baby
Shake it all you can tonight
Break it baby
Break it all....

Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song, his heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds, and I still can hear him say
"Aw talk to me, so you can see, what's going on"
Say you will sing your songs forevermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

Jackie, hey what'you doing now?
It seems like yesterday when we were working out
Jackie, you set the world on fire
You came and gifted us, your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up and we'll be there at your side
Say you will sing your songs forevermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
Gonna miss your sweet voice, that soulful noise, on the nightshift
We all remember you, your songs are coming through
And at the end of a long day, it's gonna be okay, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
You must be lost in a faraway land
I searched forever your footprints in the sand
I feel you need me, I have to answer
That desperate call that I do not understand
A burning bridge, a lonely highway
Another dark night thinking alone
What could've happened, am I just dreaming
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know
If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
So on and on I keep on running
To make the border before the light
Just one more river, then I can make it
Again you'll be in my arms tonight
If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border ...

I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how could it be?
No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you, I couldn't believe it
You took my heart, I couldn't retrieve it
Said to myself, "What's it all about?"
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic
And you know you're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do

And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane
And when the night, it gets so cold
When I can't sleep again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Who would believe it?
With a word you dry my tears

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic
And you know you're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do

And if I wanted to
I could never be free
I never believed it was so true
But now it's so clear to me

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic
And you know you're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do

De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-do-dit
Good things will come your way
You'll find a brighter day
All that I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
When he finds the key to you
All the promises
Never quite came true
Found the way to live again
When I found the key to you...
When I found the key to you
I don't mind being lonely
What I do mind is not being loved
Maybe you're feeling the same way too
You're ready to hold someone
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel, ooh
Something 'bout you tells me
We're coming from the very same place
It's only just a notion I have
I see it written over your face
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel, hey
You got something about you
That I want around me
Something I've been searching
My whole life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
Tell me what you're gonna do
I wanna know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every time I see you
It's the same thing all over again
You're doing something to me, it's true
And I don't want the feelin' to end
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel, hey
You got something about you
That I want around me
Something I've been searching
My whole life through

I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
Yes, I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna know you
Yes, I really wanna know just the way you feel

He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jukebox life, Diamond nights and 
ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator

Smooth operator

Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western Maine
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale

Face-to-face, each classic case
We shadow box and double-cross
Yet need the chase

A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels; his heart is cold

No need to ask
He's a smooth operator

(Ooh, ooh, ah)

Now I told you, so you ought to know (ooh)
It takes some time for a feeling to grow (ooh)
But you're so close now, I can't let you go (ooh)
And I can't let go

(With you I'm not shy) to show the way I feel
(With you I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel

I can't hope that I'll hold you for long (ooh)
You're a woman who's lost to your song (ooh)
But the love that I feel is so strong (ooh)
And it can't be wrong

(With you I'm not shy) to show the way I feel
(With you I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel
(Ooh)

For you are a magnet and I am steel

Time was drifting
This rocker got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, really got a hold
I started searching for a better way

But I kept on 
looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

LA fever made me feel alright
But I must admit it got the best of me
Getting down, so deep I could have drowned
Now, I can't get back the way I used to be

But I kept on 
looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right


New York City took me with the tide
And I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another no account fatality

But I kept on 
looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right
I kept on 
looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right
I kept on 
looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right
Hate New York City
It's cold and it's damp
And all the people dressed like monkeys
Let's leave Chicago to the Eskimos
That town's a little bit too rugged
For you and me you bad girl
Rollin' down
Imperial Highway
With a big nasty redhead at my side
Santa Ana winds blowin' hot from the north
And we was born to ride
Roll down the window
Put down the top
Crank up the Beach Boys baby, don't let the music stop
We're gonna ride it till we just can't ride it no more
From the South Bay
To the Valley
From the West Side
To the East Side
Everybody's very happy
Cause the sun is shining all the time
Looks like another perfect day
I love L.A. (We love it)
I love L.A. (We love it)
Look at that mountain
Look at those trees
Look at that bum over there, man, he's down on his knees
Look at these women
There ain't nothin' like 'em nowhere
Century Boulevard (We love it)
Victory Boulevard (We love it)
Santa Monica Boulevard (We love it)
Sixth Street (We love it, we love it)
I love L.A
I love L.A
(We love it)

You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
I look around me, and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
 (I love you)
Now can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me (I love you)
Now can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know, 'cause here I go again

I love you
I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all


How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)


I love you
I love you
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say, can't you see?)
I love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say, can't you see?)
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?)

I love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me
Say, can't you see?)

I love you
(I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?)

I love you
(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me
Say, can't you see?)



You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh, no
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
I held her near
Told her how much I cared
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Everyday
When she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I spend the night
Dreaming how she used to be
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Yes It Was
Cause she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone,  my big legged girl is gone
She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl
She, she's my girl
She's so foxy can't you see
And this girl belongs to me
She's my girl
When we walk down the street
I would tell everyone we meet
This is my girl
She, she was my girl
I loved, I loved ...

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl, but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

Don't you know? Don't you know?
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong, 'cause

You're a rich girl (Rich girl)
And you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far, get you too far

High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow, ooh
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh

You're a rich girl (Rich girl) and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway (Rich girl)
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch, girl (Bitch, girl), and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway, yeah (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far, get you too far
And you say, you can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money

You're a rich girl (Rich girl)
A rich girl
Oh, you're a rich bitch girl, yeah (Rich girl)
Say money but it won't get you too far
Won't get you too far
I got lost on the road somewhere
Was it Texas or was it Canada
Drinking whiskey in the morning light
I work the stage all night long
At first we laughed about it
My long-haired drunken friends
Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost
I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end
I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
I'm just another case
Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside
All got your kicks from what you saw up there
Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long
You were screaming for the villain up there
And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
It's hard to see where the vicious circle ends
I'm stuck here on the inside looking out
That's no big disgrace
Where's my makeup where's my face on the inside
Heard you say that you didn't like the state that the world is in
(It's just a part of the times)
Not a day passes that your faith in man don't get mighty grim
(It's just a part of the times, of the times)
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
If you're just a part of the times, oh
Don't dismay 'cause the dollar won't buy all the things you need
(It's just a part of the times)
You must pay 'cause some other's gettin' high on his selfish greed
(It's just a part of the times)
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you think life is much too unkind
You want to settle back into the old days of serenity
But you're just a part of the times, oh
You know you can go on from here
Dim the past your future's clear
(It's just a part of the times)
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
If you're just a part of the times, oh
You will not get a thing for a dime
You struggle through the passion the greed and the crime
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
If you're just a part of the times, oh
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
If you're just a part of the times, oh
You say you want to have piece of mind
You tell me that you find life is much too unkind
But who else can you blame for the state of your mentality
If you're just a part of the times, oh

I heard some talk around this town
Talk about you and me
How a fool fell out of love with you
Wanted to be free
Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
That I've thrown our love away
And left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say
I read your letter again
I'm sure you know the one
"Goodbye," you said like a coward
"It'll be better in the long run"
Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
That I've thrown our love away
Left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say
Go back to her again
Back to the way you were
She's a damn sight better for you
You're a damn sight better for her
Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
When you've thrown our love away
Left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say

It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All round the day was goin' down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on, are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing, 
now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something, and the music's loud
A girl comes towards you, you once used to know
You reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these
Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
In the littlest hours 'tween the dusk and dawn
While the nightlight glows with the music on
You could climb so high in the dreamtime sky
And go anywhere
In that sometime place ever lost somehow
In the here and gone or the there and now
Did it all go bust — crumble down in dust
Or just slip away
Paging Audrey
Any random star
Lost and lonely
Somewhere very far
Paging Audrey
Come in from the cold
In that far-off room drenched in desert sun
Evil words were spoke — dirty deeds were done
Could we sail back there snatch them from the air
I dare anyone
Can we stand right here, call them back and say
Those were never meant to be heard that way
Let the heavens crack — let the day go black
I'd give anything
Paging Audrey
Somewhere very near
Safe and silent
There you are my dear
Paging Audrey
Anybody home
In a distant room certain things were said
As the loved one lies on the love-torn bed
And the night rolls on and by light of dawn
You're not anywhere
Paging Audrey
This is who we are
Do remember
On any random star
Paging Audrey
Coming strong and pure

Now
The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

You
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read:

"If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape"

I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad:

"Yes, I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And 
cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape"

So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, "Aw, it's you"
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, "I never knew..."

"...That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape"

If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

Yes I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found
Somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy, interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by
You know I got that
I got that cheeba, cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that he found
Somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey
Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
He's got that, he's got that interplanetary, good
Good vibe zone

Oh, good times, hard times, good vibes, hey
Oh, I like what you're doing on that, yeah
This time

Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, interplanetary, good vibe zone
At the speed of cheeba, oh you and I
You and I go deeper, hey
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high this time
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey
We're going deeper, yeah
We're going deeper, yeah
We're going deeper, yeah
Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Good times, hard times, good vibes, oh
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Yeah, I know from where it's comin' from
Now we've got people
At the speed of cheeba
You and I go deeper
I'll stay with you on this
On this interplanetary level
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, hey, a good vibe zone
Speed, speed, at the speed of cheeba
Oh you and I, you and I, oh you and I go
Hey, hey, hey, you and I go deeper, deeper
I wanna go, I wanna go deeper with you
You know, you got that, you got the space cowboy vibe
Interplanetary, good vibes, good vibes, good times
At the speed of cheeba
Gotta go, gotta go, got to go

Growin' up
You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone, everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're trying to break free

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my futures lyin', 
St. Elmo's Fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road
I can make it, I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my futures lyin', St. Elmo's Fire
I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin' in me

Just once in his life, a man has his time
And my time is now, I'm coming alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like a man again, I'll hold my head high
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin', St. Elmo's fire

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin' higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion
All I need is a pair of wheels
Take me where my futures lyin', St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burnin' in me
Burnin' in me
Burnin'
Burnin' in me
I can feel it burnin'
Ooh, burnin' inside of me
Thank you for being a friend
Traveled down the road and back again
Your heart is true
You're a pal and a confidant
I'm not ashamed to say
I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off
Won't you stand up and take a bow
And if you threw a party
Invited everyone you knew
You would see
The biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
"Thank you for being a friend."
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
If it's a car you lack
I'd surely buy you a Cadillac
Whatever you need
Anytime of the day or night
I'm not ashamed to say
I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off
Won't you stand up and take a bow
And when we both get older
With walking canes and hair of gray
Have no fear, even though it's hard to hear
I will stand real close and say
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Let me tell you bout a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
And when we die and float away
Into the night, the Milky Way
You'll hear me call, as we ascend
I'll see you there, then once again
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
(I want to thank you)
Thank you for being a friend
Whoa, tell you about a friend
(Thank you right now, for being a friend)
Thank you for being a friend
(I wanna tell you right now, and tell you again)
Thank you for being a friend
(I wanna thank you, thank you, for being a friend)
Thank you for being a friend

She's just sixteen years old
Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet
But I want you to know

If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart
And I would wait till the end of time for you
And do it again, it's true
I can't measure my love
There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know

If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Oh, if I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen
Yeah, ooh

If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Oh, if I could fly, I'd pick you up
And take you into the night

(Into the night, fly) if I could fly
I'd pick you up
Oh into the night
I'd pick you up

Step right up, and don't be shy
Because you will not believe your eyes
She's right here, behind the glass
You're gonna like her 'cause she's got class

You can look inside another world
You get to talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about

(But don't fall in love)
She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls)
She's a beauty
(Why would I lie?)
Why would I lie?

You can say anything you like
But you can't touch the merchandise
She'll give you every penny's worth
But it will cost you a dollar first

You can step outside your little world
(Step outside your world)
You can talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about

(But don't fall in love)
She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls)
One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?)
Why would I lie?

(But don't fall in love)
'Cause if you do, you'll find out she don't love you
(She's one in a million girls)
One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?)
Now, why would I lie? Oh


(Step outside your world)

(But don't fall in love)
She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls)
One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?)
Now, why would I lie?

(But don't fall in love)
'Cause if you do, you'll find out she don't love you
(She's one in a million girls)
One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?)
Why would I lie?

(But don't fall in love)
(She's one in a million girls)
(Why would I lie?)
I've been standin' here, for oh so long
Tryin' to figure out girl, where we went wrong
Standin' here, on the edge of time
Waitin' for you baby, I might change your mind
But maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
Oh and maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on
'Cause you and me took the love so far
Had a beautiful thing that somehow went wrong
A whole lotta laughs have turned into tears
Turn your head around, we've been through some years
And maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
And maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on
Maybe I'm a fool and maybe you're right
But I'll never really change and I don't wanna fight
You say, "No, no, no, no"
You keep sayin', "No, not now"
I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
You keep no, no, no, no
But I can't let you go now baby
You got mad, I got mad, don't we really care?
Well now, maybe I'm a fool still lovin' you
And maybe I'm wrong 'cause I'm still hangin' on
And maybe I'm a fool and maybe you're right
But I'll never really change and I don't wanna fight
Maybe maybe, baby baby I'm a fool
Maybe maybe maybe I should stop lovin' you
Huh, maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
Maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on, I say
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Woah oh
I wanna say again
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Woah oh
Well, there's too many windows
In this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy
And the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside
Nobody living inside
Gonna pull in the shutters
On this heart of mine
Roll up the carpets
And pull in the blinds
And retreat to the chambers
That I left behind
In hopes there still may be love left to find
Still may be love left to find
Seek inspiration in daily affairs
Now your soul is in trouble and requires repairs
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers
Echoes of unanswered prayers
Well, there's too many windows
In this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy
And the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside
Nobody living inside
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo

Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why


I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

Don't, don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you but you're the only one

You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
Can't understand
Why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
With the silly, silly games we play
We've got our love
And no matter how it's said or done
We are one no matter what we do
We are one our love will see us through
We are one and that's the way it is
We are one
Sometimes I feel
That we try and make each other sad
I don't know why
The things we do
How we make each other feel so bad
We've got so much
We could all be having so much fun
We are one from the very start
We are one deep down in your heart
We are one
And that's the way it is
We are one
I can't understand
Why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
With the silly silly games we play, play
We've got our love, our love
And no matter how it's said or done
We are one
We are one
You can't get away
We are one
We are one
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
We are one
We are one
Splish splash I was taking a bath
Long ago a saturday night
A rub-a-dub, just relaxing in my tub
Thinking everything was alright
And when I stepped out the tub
Put feet on the floor, I wrapped the towel around me
And I opened up my door and than
Oeh, splish splash! I jumped back in the bath
How was I to know there was a party going on?
How was I to know there was a party going on? yeah yeah!
Bing bang I saw the whole gang
Dancing on my living-room rug
They're getting high, they walk round the spa
Shaking like they're taking a drug
So I put on the jacket and roll up the wine
Turned the music louder than I turned off my mind
And than oh!
Splish, splash the old man in the bath
Don't get wet and have a good time, I said now
Don't get wet and have a good time. yeah yeah!
I was splishing and splashing
I was rolling and strolling
I was moving and grooving
I was reeling with feeling
Sniffing, sliding, siding, gliding
Moving, grooving, rolling strolling
Sure to love to splish and splash with you
Sure to love to splish and splash with you
How was I to know there was a party going on
How was I to know there was a party going on
Sure to love to splish and splash with you
Sure to love to splish and splash with you
Come on, don't be silly
Stop that!
Oh, you're crazy
Sure to love to splish and splash with you
Sure to love to splish and splash with you
It's getting hot...

Kissing you was not what I had planned
And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me
You're the only one I can think of
You're the only one I see

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

Yes it's true we've all been hurt before
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're making
Then I don't know what it is

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

No stars are out tonight
But we're shining our own light
And it's never felt so bright
Cause girl the way I'm feeling
It's easy to believe
That you're all I need

Ahhhh
You're all I need
Oooooh ahhhh
It used to be so easy to be your lover
We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend
Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
So now I'll go the minstrel road without
I know there will be times when I need you there
And each night as I sing those songs about you
I'll think back to the time when you used to care
Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Oh baby don't leave me crying
It should be easy to see
I've needed you for so long
Just one more chance with you
One more chance will you, take chance?
Come on and take a chance
Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
It's still up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
She's got your eyes
She's got my nose
Oh, I get high just watching her grow
I always dreamed we'd live in a castle, oh but
We're in the same old shack
Sometimes we get into a hassle
But we always take each other back
Oh, you know
All our friends seem to be in a hurry
But we'll just keep on taking our time
We're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Sharing my love with you
Oh, we're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Making our dreams come true
We're makin our dreams come ture
You are my love
You are my life
Oh, and I get high just holding you tight
We always dreamed we'd make a lot of money, oh but
I don't mind being poor
'Cause when you make love to me, honey
I couldn't ask for anymore
Oh, you know, all our friends seem to be in a hurry
But darlin' we'll just keep on taking our time
We're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Sharing my love with you
We're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Making our dreams come true
We're making our dreams come true
Oh, oh
We're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Sharing my love with you
We're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Making our dreams come true
We're making our dreams come true

Daylight turns to moonlight and I'm at my best
Praising the way it all works, and gazing upon the rest, yeah
The cool before the warm, the calm after the storm
The cool before the warm, the calm after the storm

I wish to stay forever, letting this be my food
Oh, but I'm caught up in a whirlwind
And my ever changing moods, yeah

Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet for me won't be too soon, no
The hush before the silence, the winds after the blast
The hush before the silence, the winds after the blast

I wish we'd move together, this time the bosses sued
Oh, but we're caught up in the wilderness
And an ever changing mood, yeah


Teardrops turn to children who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through another's evil mind
The love after the hate, the love we leave too late
The love after the hate, the love we leave too late

I wish we'd wake up one day, an' everyone feel moved
Oh, but we're caught up in the dailies
And an ever changing mood, yeah

Evil turns to statues and masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to, if the choice was mine
The past is knowledge, the present our mistake
And the future we always leave too late

I wish we'd come to our senses and see there is no truth
In those who promote the confusion
For this ever changing mood, yeah
Bombs away
I guess I'm back in love again
Well hey and around we go
This will bring me ruin
Though I suppose it's pleasing
I've changed the eyes I gaze in
But she's just another girl
I need more than a trade-in
Guess I'll have to change the world
Strike up the band
I believe I have this dance
Hey raise that glass again my friend
Yes, I know I'm charming
But she's so easy
I've changed the tune I dance to
In this gay old social whirl
But if I get a chance to
I might just changе the world
It's just the same old moviе
Been playing here for years
I could use a change of scenery
But when I get there I'm still here
Coming soon
Hey another day in paradise
At a theatre near you
And they'll be showing it forever
So let them keep parading
Give them all batons to twirl
For me the splendor's fading
Yeah, I'll have to change the world
Yes it's still the same old movie
And I seen it all before
Guess one more run through won't undo me
Hell, I'll just watch the show some more
Hey some more, yeah some more
Sit back and watch it some more
Guess I'll just watch the show some more
Hey some more, yeah some more
But I'd like to know what for
Hey don't you worry what for
Bombs away
Well I guess I'm back in love again
Hey round and round we go

You said you'd never fake it
You swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real
And I fell into your love trap
Blind, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word
And it never occurred to me

Is this a game?
Are you just playin'?
Will I be losin' you?

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

My friends warned me about ya
I laughed, how could I doubt your love?
Then I saw you with him
And my world crumbled around me
I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me
Where my heart used to be

So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you

Oh, I'm a victim of love, victim of love
Well, you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love
Well, I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
You were only usin' me
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
What a fool you made of me

So now, this was a game
You were just playin'
And now I'm losin' you

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love?
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love
Were you only usin' me?
Victim of love, victim of love
Did you take me for a ride?
Victim of love, victim of love
Then I hope you're satisfied
I was half in mind, I was half in need
And as the rain came down, I dropped to my knees and I prayed
I said, oh, heavenly thing, please cleanse my soul
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all
I was halfway home, I was half insane
And every shop window I looked in just looked the same
I said now send me a sign to save my life
Cause at this moment in time there's nothing certain
In these days of mine
Y'see, it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked I might as well stay
And promise myself each and every day
That when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else but
To shout to the top
Whoa, we're gonna shout to the top
We're gonna shout to the top
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top
Oh, we're gonna shout to the top
Y'see, it's a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked I might as well stay
And promise myself each and every day
Oh, when you shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
So when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, shout
Whoa, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
So when you're knocked on your back and your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else but
To shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
Mm, we're gonna shout to the top, shout
Shout (shout to the top, shout)
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top)
(Shout to the top, shout)
(Shout to the top, shout)
She seems a million miles away
When she walks by you don't know what to say
You gonna make a move, you better make it now
Don't be afraid, cause love will show you how
You take that first step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step
Tell her she's the one you're dreaming of
Third step
Take her in your arms and never let her go
Don't you know step by step
Step by step
You'll win her love
She looks too beautiful to touch
But your heart keeps talking to you now
Don't give up
You think you see something in her eye
But you will never know until you try
But you gotta take that first step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady

There were beverages laid out for the party
There were candy and spices and 
tricolored pastas
The meat carved was drawn from succulent juices
Served on platters of the purest gold
I was calm when we arrived at the party
I spoke with fervor, embracing the evening
My wife leaned over and she whispered 'I love you'
I held her close - we danced
We had the best time at your party
The wife and I thank you very much
We had the best time at your party
The wife and I thank you very much
Creampuffs and bourbon and the music was louder
My wife was competing in a game of chance
The party raged and the guests were screaming
I could have danced all night
We had the best time at your party
The wife and I thank you very much
We had the best time at your party
The wife and I thank you very much
Later on when we were under the covers
I closed my eyes, then I drifted to sleep
I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party
And just how great that would be
And we said
We had the best time at your party
The wife and I thank you very much
We had the best time at your party
The wife and I thank you very much

Can you understand me
Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time

There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Ohh, there's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

I don't want no damage
But how am I going to manage with you
Ohh, you hold the percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues

I'm-a just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waitin' for you
If you ever want to be there

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

(Oh won't you)
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me


(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and)
Hold me, hold me, hold me

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold 
She bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman
This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me
To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Lean streaky music
Spawned on the streets
I hear it but with you
I had to go
'Cause my rock 'n' roll
Is putting on weight
And the beat it goes on
Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
Daytime and nighttime
I feel you near
Warm water breathing
She helps me here
But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate
With you my love
We're going to raid the future
With you my love
We're going to stick up the past
We'll hold today to ransom
'Til our quartz clock stop
Until yesterday
Whoa, until yesterday
Until yesterday
'Til our quartz clock stop

Lately, I've been so crazy
I want to talk to you
I need to talk to you
And lately, you ain't my baby
I want a word with you, (i want a word with you
A moment alone with you

'Cause you, you were a part of my heaven, my shining star
And now, i look at you and i wonder just who you are

It's no secret
What your love, (what your love) what your love is doing to me
It's no secret
That your love, (that your love) that your love, that your love is killing me

Lately, I've been so lonely
I need a smile from you, (i need a smile from you
Something to pull me through
But we know, love can be mellow
If we can just talk it through, (we can just talk it through
It's going to feel brand new. (feel brand new



Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da, 
da-da-da-da-da-da

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed?
High rise blocks out the blue
The pavement sticks like glue
You're getting nowhere
Hitch a ride on a wing and a prayer
When you're crying out loud
A face lost in the crowd
A voice no-one can hear
You'll get by on a wing and a prayer
So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will...
Go. Rain, thunder, blowing down
(You better believe it, love is everywhere)
(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)
Feels like you're gonna drown
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
Reach out, no one's there
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
Just hold on to a wing and a...
Prayer. Like smoke in the air
(It's just a little homegrown philosophy)
(Take it or leave it, it comes for free)
You'll slowly slip away
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
All senses prevail
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
You'll fly home on a wing and a prayer
So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go
Now you walk that high wire
(You better believe it, love is everywhere)
(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)
In truth you'll want to fly
(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)
You'll fly everywhere
(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
So let it be
Let the breeze carry you to the sea
Let the wind take you where it will go
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing
It's just a little homegrown philosophy
Take it or leave it, it comes for free
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
You better believe it, love is everywhere
And if you can feel it, you're halfway there
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing
If you trust to a wing and a prayer
Just a little homegrown philosophy
Take it or leave it, it comes for free
It's just another love song, ain't no big thing
...

So long
I've been lookin' too hard, I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time

When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm comin' on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I want to be sure

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

You're so good
When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way

When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone
Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up 'til deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
A love that will survive
I've been waiting for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life

I've been waiting
Waiting for you
Ooh-ooh
I've been waiting
I've been waiting, yeah
Won't you come into my life?
My life?

I've just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the Dream Weaver train
Driver, take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Or maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, Dream Weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Dream Weaver
Dream Weaver

You know I need your love
You've got that hold over me
Long as I've got your love
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman
Right down the line

I know how much I lean on you
Only you can see
The changes that I've been through
Have left a mark on me
You've been as 
constant as a Northern Star
The brightest light that shines
It's been you, woman
Right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more

Cause you believed in me
Through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me
You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams
I put them all behind
And it was you, woman
Right down the line


I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more

If I should doubt myself
If I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman
Right down the line
Oh babe , I got it crazy
We both been broken in sorrow
We need to try for tomorrow
Where our feelings start and I lose my heart to you
Oh lover , I've just discovered
My life was falling around me
I was lost when you found me
And you turned my head and my fire was fed
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
You keep shining through when ev'rything's out of sight
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
And you put all the life back in my eyes
You're making me feel like I've never felt
I never was one for a party, look at me now
Oh babe , we must be crazy
We could be living in heaven
I'd take you there in a second
Never been this far
Gotta trust our hearts
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
You keep shining through when ev'rything's out of sight
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
And you put all the life back in my eyes
You're making me feel like I've never felt
I never was one for a party , look at me now
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
You keep shining through when ev'rything's out of sight
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
And you put all the life back in my eyes
I go for you
You light up the darkest night
I keep shining through when ev'rything's out of sight
I go for you
And you put the life back in my eyes
I go for you
I go for you
I go for you
You've got Sicilian imagination
Second generation
And a long way from the family crime
But you've got your own way
Sign on the line, sign on the line, on the line
You're a patent-leather lover
With your Gucci-Pucci pointed shoes
And you're swearing on your mother
That "all this could be yours"
Sign on the line, sign on the line, on the line
Remember hard work means something
Live fast, die laughing
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing
Gino no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no!
You've got contractual agitation
Transcendental meditation works fine
But now you're paying off the guru
Get to heaven on time
Sign on the line, sign on the line, on the line
Remember hard work means something
Live fast, die laughing
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing
You couldn't live without little Gino, no
That's what he tells me, little Gino, no
You couldn't live without little Gino, no
That's what he tells me, little Gino, no no
Boy you think you’re in control
You’re just an actor in someone else’s show
Are you chosen by the ones who pull the strings?
A young lover, or a master of the fling
Playing the lottery
Lovers and pretty dreams
Dancers of destiny
Playing the lottery
One thing about this place I know so well
It shines like an oyster in a shell
We’re spoiled with dreams
Watching the spinning wheel
Playing the lottery
Winners with pretty genes
You’ll see them on TV
Playing the lottery
Grab a ticket get on board
One last prayer to the Lord
Destination LA
A smile for every mile and sunshine every day
You took swing, got a hit, next day struck out, sorry kid
Some see the cash and fun
Others the setting sun
They’re just like you and me
Playing the lottery


Baby, if you've ever wondered
Wondered whatever became of me
I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP

Got kind of tired packing and unpacking
Town to town and up and down the dial
Maybe you and me were never meant to be
But baby think of me once in awhile

Heading up that highway
Leaving you behind
Hardest thing I've ever had to do
Broke my heart in two
But Baby, pay no mind
The price for finding me was losing you

Memories help me hide my lonesome feelin'
Far away from you and feelin' low
It's gettin' late my friend, I miss you so
Take good care of you, I've gotta go

Baby, if you've ever wondered
Wondered whatever became of me
I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP

Got kind of tired packing and unpacking
Town to town and up and down the dial
Maybe you and me were never meant to be
But baby think of me once in awhile
I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati

Baby hair, with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on
You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara

If you feel like leaving, you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so

When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile, Sara

Smile awhile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara
Oh, smile awhile
Won't you laugh, Sara
Thank you for making me feel like a man
Not keeping me crazy, crazy
Smile awhile
In every city whether it be large or small
His tired playlist drones
But some of us remember how much choice there was
Before he took the throne
He's Mr. Smooth - His Hipness, the Great
For Mr. Smooth's verdict we must wait
So Mr. Smooth, when out turn comes round
Dear Mr. Smooth, we only hope it won't be "thumbs down"
His power and reputation he earned cleverly:
Play fifteen-second tracks
Then just tape the electrodes to the average Joe
To see how he reacts
The rest of us mere mortals on the treadmill trace
Out work-a-day gulag
And strive for the tome until the day he falls from grace
And rivals fold the flag of Mr. Smooth
WE bow to Mr. Smooth
Kowtow to Mr. Smooth
We're stuck with Mr. Smooth
Don't ____ with Mr. Smooth!


Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know


Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
 what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know
In the heart of the night
In the cool southern rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shining down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
She reminds me of you
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Oh, whoa, down in New Orleans
There's a night bird singing
Right on through till the dawn
And the streets are still ringing
With people carrying on
It's been so long waiting
Just to be here again
Anticipating
All the time I could spend
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
And I trust in your love never falling down
I trust in your love
Just like I do in this town
Whoa, never falling down
Whoa, never falling down
In the heart of the night
In the cool fallin' rain
There's a full moon in sight
Shining down on the Pontchartrain
And the river she rises
Just like she used to do
She's so full of surprises
Oh, momma, she reminds me of you
Right here, in the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
Down in New Orleans
And I'm so glad to be back in New Orleans
Please don't wake me, don't shake me
If it's only, if it's only just a dream
It's the only place I can face that feels so right
Below that Dixie moon and loving you
In the heart of the night
One day you're up
Next day you're down
She's got your head
Spinning around
That's love
It's happening all the time
You walk out the door
Head for the train
Then in a while
You're back again
That's love, you'll never change the world
Not in a million years
And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times
One gentle heart easily burned
After a lifetime
You still haven't learned
That's love, it's happening all the time
And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times
Young couple there
Going insane
Fussing and fighting
Then they make up again
That's love, it's happening all the time
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
No, no, no, no
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
Opening night, nothing new Atlanta
Into the spotlight, one more time
Just in time to play
To one man and an empty table
He was drinking down the pain
All he could say was this lady's name...
Oh camellia won't you take me away
After the show, when the room was empty
No, he wouldn't go
So I asked him why he called her name
It seems she was some magic one night
With something for his pain
But all she left was a pretty name...
Oh camellia won't you take me away
To paradise tropical moon
Don't you leave me sitting here in Atlanta
When desire moves from head to heart
You may lose the luxury
To have your fun and play it smart
Take your pleasure and still be free
Oh, the loneliness at the end of every dream
Don't you know that there's more to this
Let go of all your reasons
And find something to believe
You gotta find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart now baby
Love's the truth that sets us free
You'll only find it in your heart
Now you found someone who cares
You got your life all figured out
But the truth is you're not really there
'Till you give in beyond a doubt
Let go of your fantasies
And start looking for something real
Your best thinking is what got you here
Illusion will be shattered by the truth that love reveals
You better find it in your heart
You'll only find it in your heart now baby
Love's the key that sets us free
Oh girl, get out of your head
Let go of your fantasies
And start looking for something real
Your best thinking is what got you here
Illusion will be shattered by the truth that love reveals
You better find it in your heart
You gotta find it in your heart now baby
Love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head
You may think it's a matter of choice
But there's only one answer, only one voice
You better find it in your heart
You gotta find it in your heart now baby
Love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it in your heart now
You better find it in your heart baby
Love's the truth that sets us free
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, find it baby
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Find it, you better find it in your heart
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it in your heart
You better find it in your heart now baby
Your love will never be the same
Oh girl, get out of your head
Find it in your heart
You stole my heart the moment you came to town
I said "hello" but you were gone when I turned around
You can't get away, can't get away, even if you try now
I wanna tell you but the words just can't be found
I like the way you move and just the way you are
I can't take anymore, 'cos girl, your pushing too hard
You can't get away, can't let you go, what's a boy to do now
You got me askin' myself how I survived so far
I gotta get away from you, girl
'Cos I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do
Never been afraid of - Never been afraid of love 'til I met you
Ooh, yes you say
Can't be something that you never ever had
When I stop and think about you, it makes me laugh
You took me by surprise, saw it in your eyes, never had a chance, girl
Now that I see what you are, it doesn't hurt so bad
I gotta get away from you, girl
'Cos I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do
Never been afraid of - Never been afraid of love 'til I met you
Ooh, yes you say
I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong
Why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused
Feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me
And my loneliness left me
I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak
But now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you
You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see
That you feel the same way
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you
(Guitar Instrumental)
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
(fade)

We've been together since way back when
Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whispering in my ear

You're still the one I want to talk to in bed
Still the one that turns my head
We're still having fun and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (Wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one that makes me laugh
Still the one that's my better half
We're still having fun and you're still the one
You're still the one that makes me strong
Still the one I want to take along
We're still having fun and you're still the one
Yes, you are
Ooh
Ooh

Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one that I love to touch
Still the one and I can't get enough
We're still having fun and you're still the one
You're still the one who can scratch my itch
(You're) Still the one that I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun and you're still the one
You are still the one that makes me shout
Still the one that I dream about
We're still having fun and you're still the one
You are still the one
You're still the one
We're still having fun and you're still the one
Don't rush me, just this once
I want to make this moment last
Slow down the pace, there's no hurry
I can't let another pass me by again
Let me be the one to say when I've had enough
Just let me, close my eyes, memorize
The way things are this minute
So when you're gone, I can go on
If memory can hold within it what I'm feeling
Should time try fading or stealing something away
Hold on, nothing's the same
Tell me why I feel this way
Life wouldn't be worth living without you
All along I've been the pretender
But now that's gone forever
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
Nobody's broken through
Got to concentrate, file away
Every last detail
I don't want to lose what's going down
I want to remember everything I'm feeling
Should time try fading or stealing something away
Hold on, nothing's the same
Tell me why I feel this way
Life wouldn't be worth living without you
All along I've been the pretender
But now that's gone forever
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
Nobody's broken through
(Nobody's ever loved like you)
Nobody loves me like you do
(Nobody's ever broken through)
Nobody's ever broken through
(Nobody's ever loved like you)
(No nobody's loves like you)
Nobody's ever broken through
(Nobody's ever broken through)

If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

There's lots of those friendly people
They're showing me ways to go
But I never want to lose their inspiration

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
And now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

Well, I was born in the sign of water
And it's there that I feel my best
The albatross and the whales, they are my brothers

It's kind of a special feeling
When you're out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool change

I've never been romantic
And sometimes I don't care
I know it may sound selfish
But let me breathe the air
Yeah, yeah
Let me breathe the air

If there's one thing in my life that's missing
It's the time that I spend alone
Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

It's kind of a special feeling
Out on the sea alone
Staring at the full moon like a lover

Time for a cool change
I know that it's time for a cool change
Now that my life is so prearranged
I know that it's time for a cool, cool, cool change

(Time for a cool change)
It's time, it's time, it's time, it's time
For a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Ooh, I know it's time for a cool, cool change
(Time for a cool change)
Now that my life is so prearranged
Well, I know, I know, I know, I know
(Time for a cool change)
It's time for a cool change
Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is
You know it's time for a cool change

Ooh baby, you couldn't have done
A worse thing to me
If you'd have taken an arrow
And run it right through me, ooh

Ooh baby, a bird in the hand
Is worth two flying
But when it came to love
I knew you'd be lying

It could have been a finer fling
Would have been a major attraction
With no other thing
Offering a note of distraction
Come on, get up, get under way
And bring your love

Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found
A more down hero
If you'd have started at nothing
And counted to zero


Ooh baby, you couldn't have done
A worse thing to me
If you'd have taken an arrow
And run it right through me

It could have been a finer fling
Flying in a righter direction
With no other thing
Featuring but love and affection
Come on, get up, get under way
And bring your love

Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found
A more down hero
If you'd have started at nothing
And counted to zero
It’s funny how the whole thing started
But you found your way into my heart
I always figured that you were innocent, girl
And it was plain to see that you’d been hurt
I can’t be your savior
I’ll never erase the past
I can’t over look what you’ve done – Oh, look what you’ve done
You say you want to change but you can’t
Yeah – Yeah
I’ve been taking a cold look – a cold look
Oh, and I don’t like what I see
I’m taking a cold look – a cold look
Oh, and your love’s been hurtin’ me
I’ve been takin’ a cold look
Yeah yeah – cold look
Sometimes I don’t express my feelings
I can’t expect you to guess
But this hasn’t been fun for such a long time
And I just can’t go on like this
Now don’t try to hold me
Don’t say we’ll make it one last time
I’m gonna make a clean break, admit my mistake
‘Cause this is killing me inside
Yeah yeah
I’ve been taking a cold look – a cold look
Oh, and I don’t like what I see
I’m taking a cold look – a cold look
Oh, and your love’s been hurtin’ me
I’ve been takin’ a cold look
Yeah yeah – cold look
Don’t try to ask me, baby, what went wrong
You don’t want to hear it ‘cause you’re not that strong
I’ve been holding it back too long
I’ve been taking a cold look – a cold look
Oh, and I don’t like what I see
I’m taking a cold look – a cold look
Oh, and your love’s been hurtin’ me
I’ve been takin’ a cold look
Yeah yeah – cold look
I am a studio musician
We've never met, but you know me well
I am the English horn that played the poignant counter-line
Upon the song you heard while making love in some hotel
I am a part of you, I've never tried for fame
You'll never know my name
I am the strings that enter softly
Or three guitars that glitter gold
I am the thousand trumpet lines that were an afterthought
Intended as a way to get a dying record sold
I never ride the road, I never play around
I play what they set down
I'm a working musician, pulling my five a week
I'm the voice through which empty men try to speak
A studio musician
Blowing the chance I seek
And when the woodwind cushion rises
I start to dream with the low brass bed
And I reject the riffs and Hendrix licks they've paid me for
That I've played before
Instead, they want what I hear in my head
But I awake to horns, the drummer calls to me
"We're up to Letter D!"
I'm a man of the moment, pop is my stock-in-trade
Singles, jingles, and demos conveniently made
A studio musician
Whose music will die unplayed
Get up now baby
Shake the door
And give a big kiss to the sky
There's coke on the table
Where is my heart?
Do I look all that bad all the time?
We crossed the mighty sea
And did the shimmy to forever
The cop showed up, they took us there
And sold us down the river
And Arbuckle's swan song plays on the flight
All the way from L.A. to Hong Kong
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for you, hon
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for you, hon
They got no other boys to show
You're off from your head to your toes
Your body's making money on the side of the road
Climb on in and let's roll
To my questions you've got answers
And they always start with never
The last one at the party
Never has their shit together
And Arbuckle's swan song plays on the flight
All the way from L.A. to Hong Kong
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for you, hon
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for you, hon
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for you, hon
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for ya
Who's got love for you, hon

No more timing
Each tear that falls from my eyes
I`m not hiding the remedy
To cure this old heart of mine

I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

Moving sidewalks
I don`t see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below
Where the streets
See me lonely for you, oh

I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

(I can dream about you)
I`m gonna press
My lips against you
And hold you to me
(I can dream about you)
You know you got me
Spellbound
What else can it be?
Moving sidewalks
I don`t see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart
Cause it`s you that I need
I can dream
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
I can dream
Yes, I can dream
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
I don`t understand it
Can`t keep my mind off loving you
(Not even for a minute)
Oooh
Now baby
I`m caught up in the magic
I see in you
There`s one thing to do

I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
Oh, I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream
I can dream
I can dream about you
I can dream about you

He was born on a summer day, 1951
And with a slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son
His mother and father said, "What a lovely boy
We'll teach him what we learned, ah, yes, just what we learned
We'll dress him up warmly, and we'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight, to be nobody's fool"

Oh, oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

In the summer of '53, his mother brought him a sister
And she told him, "We must attend to her needs
She's so much younger than you"
Well, he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh, how could his parents have lied?
When they said he was their only son
He thought he was their only one

Oh, oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

Goodbye Mama
Goodbye you
Goodbye Papa
I'm pushing on through

He left home on a winter day, 1969
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time
Well, his sister grew up, and she married a man
He gave her a son, ah, yes, a lovely son
They dressed him up warmly, they sent him to school
It taught him how to fight, to be nobody's fool

Oh, oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

Whoa-whoa-whoa, oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

The big cold city was such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day and dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Til you came along and you touched me and set me free

So we slipped away last night eased on down to the Cay
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'til the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

A bottle of rum listening to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight along the beach we ran
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'til the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

I woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleeping and honey now I realize
That anywhere with you is paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'til the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'til the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'til the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look 
[Verse 1: 
Peaches
 &amp; Herb]
I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had
Has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you 'cause I
Want you back
Hey, hey
I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such
A way of learnin' so much
I know now that I love you 'cause I
Need your touch
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
'Cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
Hey, hey

I sat here starin' at the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb
Right through the telephone line
And give you what you want so you would
Still be mine
Hey, hey
I can't go cheatin', honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce
On precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together 'cause I
Missed your kiss
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
'Cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
Hey, hey

Oh, lover, lover
This is solid love
And you're exactly what I'm dreaming of
All through the day, 
and all through the night
I`ll give you all the love I have
With all my might
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
Hey, hey

Listen baby
I won't ever let you cry, I won't let one day go by
Without holding you, without kissing you
Without loving you
Reunited
You're my everything
Only you know how to free
All the love there is in me
I wanna let you know, I won't let you go
I wanna let you know, I won't let you go
Reunited

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited


Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now


Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home


On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the Year of the Cat
She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The Year of the Cat
Well She looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in Incense and 
Patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The Year of the Cat

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the Year of the Cat

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's not so much the things you say to me
It's not the things you do
It's how I feel each time you're close to me
That keeps me close to you
Whoa oh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's not so much your pretty face I see
It's not the clothes you wear
It's more that special way you look at me
That always keeps me there
Whoa oh whoa

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's hard to tell you all the love I'm feeling
That's just not my style
You've got a way to send my senses reeling
Every time you smile
Whoa

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart
Of my heart
Ooh, of my heart

Come and look out the window
Rocky road, silver cloud
Why did you ever wonder?
How could you ever doubt me I can't work it out?

Don't you know that I love you?
Don't you know that I care?
Winter gone, snow is melting
You are here, you are mine, you are spring in the air

Don't you know that I love you?
Don't you know how I feel?
I will stand next to you love
Through the sun, through the rain
Let me say it again
Don't you know that I love you?
You're up state, up late and city fed
I'm a California label from the top of my head
Forever, ah
See a lot of open sky when the sun goes down
There's a hot lot of loving when you come around
To free me, ah
In a boat to sail, boat to sail away, ah
All those letters mailed
From a boat to sail away, ah
We are riding in a boat to sail
Bare foot, coconut and super mild
Jamaica, take a look at your own child
Forget not
Brian Wilson songs are never left behind
Don't you worry, baby, you're a friend of mine
For so long
From a boat to sail, boat to sail away, ah
All those letters mailed
From a boat to sail away, ah
We are riding in a boat to sail
We are riding in a boat to sail
I opened my eyes this morning, looked through my window outside
Suddenly something took me away by surprise
Veil on the skyline, written in broad daylight
My own name was there, how it gave me a terrible fright
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
My name's in the sky
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
Why? Why, oh, why?
Phantom writer
Tell me you're real or are you alive?
Like a sunrise, eat my home bread sign
And all too soon, I can get to fade the lines
Coming hopes, as I felt my mood fading away
Now I'm somewhere, screaming out in the day
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
My name's in the sky
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
Why? Why, oh, why?
Phantom writer
Know that you're in, there's love in your eyes
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
My name's in the sky
Yeah, yeah, phantom writer
Why? Why, oh, why?
I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly, you really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby
I don't want you, but I need you
Don't want to kiss you, but I need you
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now you really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now, I can't, baby
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me

Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

Play
I think it's love
I feel for you, I think it's love
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think it's love
Play
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

Sometimes I feel like I'm a jar of honey
So sweet but hardly ever blue
But when the chips are down and far from sunny
Will you help me through?
Where's my rainbow? Where's my sun in the sky?
Where's that light to guide me home, yeah?
Where's my sandwich? Someone I can rely
So that I can call you homie

I just wanna know if you
Will be there for me, as a friend
Anything you're welcome to
Just roll with me, 'til the end
I just wanna know..

Would you carry me if I'm crawling
While I'm down and feeling low
Hey, cause I would be that friend
I'll be that friend for you

In that moment, in that ripple of life
Fighting clowns with evil faces, yeah
Kill that rodent, be my alibi
Put things back into their places
Woah-woah

I just wanna know if you, would be there for me, if I called
Can I really count on you, to punch with me, in a brawl
I just wanna know

Would you carry me if I'm crawling
While I'm down and feeling low
Would you catch me if I'm falling (if I'm falling)
While I'm spiraling out of control (if I'm out of control)

Hey, hey
Cause I would be that friend
(Sing it up, sing it up, sing it louder)
I'll be that friend for you, I'll be that friend for you (oh, yeah)
I'll be that friend for you, I'll be that friend for you
(Sing it up, sing it up, sing it louder)
I'll be that friend for you, I'll be that friend for you
(I would be that friend)
I'll be that friend for you, I'll be that friend for you 'til whenever
I would be that friend for you too, oh yeah
Wynken and Blynken and Nod
One night sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed in a river
Of crystal light into a sea of dew
Now where are you going?
And what do you wish?
The old moon asked of the three
Well, we're going out fishing
For herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea
Nets of silver
And gold have we said
Wynken and Blynken and Nod
The old moon laughed
And sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them
All night long ruffled the waves of dew
Well the little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets
Wherever you wish
Never as feared are we
So sang the stars
To the fisherman three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod
All night long
Their nets they threw
To the stars and the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came
The wooden shoe bringing the fisherman home
Twas all so pretty a sight
It seemed as if it could not be
And some folks thought it was
A dream they dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you
The fisherman three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod
Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe
That sailed the sky
Is a wee one's trundle bed
So close your eyes
While mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see wonderful things
As you rock on the misty sea
Where the old moon rocks
The fisherman three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod
There's a girl over there
With the rhythm everywhere
She's a very fine girl
And she's been awfully nice to me
When we walk as we sometimes do
All the way out Collins Avenue
Well it's very, very fine
Very, very special
Very
Gee, I love Miami
It's so nice and hot
And every building's so pretty and white
And I always get into so much trouble
When I'm down there
I know these two old stiffs
Live on the Waterway
That's where I like to stay
When I'm down
Miami
Blue Day
Best dope in the world
And it's free
Miami
Blue day
Put on your shortie shorts
And your Hawaiian shirt
And come down!
There's a man over there
With the conk in his hair
He's a very bad man
Don't look now
He's really very bad
And his name is Medina
And he comes from Argentina
See that little dog there with him
Well, he treats it just like it was his little boy
Oh, I love Miami
It's so hot
And the women down here
Are so impure
I love to hang around
The big hotels
And sleep in the sun all day
I know this double jointed guiy
With the circus in St. Pete
He's with me now
He says hello
From Fourteenth Street
Miami
Blue day
Best dope in the world
And it's free
Miami
Blue day
Put on your shortie shorts
And your Hawaiian shirt
And come down!

One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be found
I was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
Lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around
Fate must have woke her
Because lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door

I'm winning
And I don't intend on losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And I meant to be
It took a long time
And I knew for now
I can see the day
That I breath for
Friends agree there's a need
To play the game
And to win again




Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man

And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash

We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking?
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good?
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good?

Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself?
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too

We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom


Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Thank you!

She's been afraid to go out
She's afraid of the knock on her door
There's always a shade of a doubt
She can never be sure

Who comes to call?
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend
Anyone at all
Anything but nothing again
[Chorus] 
It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too

Seems like even her old girlfriends
Might be talking her down
She's got her name on the grapevine
Running up and down the telephone line

Talking 'bout someone said someone said something 'bout
Something else someone might have said about her
She always figured that they were her friends
But maybe they can live without her
[Chorus] 

Well, people gotten used to seeing them both together
But now he's gone and life goes on
Nothing lasts forever, oh no

She gets the house and the garden
He gets the boys in the band
Some of them his friends, some of them her friends
Some of them understand

Lord knows that this is just a small town city, yes
And everyone can see you fall
It's got nothing to do with pity
I just wanted to give you a call

It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too
You never know until it all falls down
Somebody loves you, somebody loves you
Darling, somebody still loves you
I can still remember her
When it used to be her town, too

It used to your town, it used to be my town, too
You never know until it all falls down
Somebody loves you, somebody loves you
(Vonnegut Jr. - Puerta - Pack - North - Drummond)
Oh a sleeping drunkard
Up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter in the jungle dark
Or the Chinese dentist
Or the British Queen
They all fit together in the same machine
Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
Oh a whirling dervish
And a dancing bear
Or a Ginger Rogers and a Fred Astaire
Or a teenage rocker
Or the girls in France
Yes, we all are partners in this cosmic dance
Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
I wanted all things to make sense
So we'd be happy instead of tense
Oh a sleeping drunkard
Up in Central Park
Or the lion hunter in the jungle dark
Or the Chinese dentist
Or the British Queen
They all fit together in the same machine
Nice, nice, very nice
Nice, nice, very nice
So many people in the same device
So many people in the same device

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no no
It's because...

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, no no
It's because...

Be quiet, big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

I'm not in love, no no
It's because...

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
Ooh

I'm not in love
I'm not in love
Look around you, look up here
Take time to make time, make time to be there
Look around, be a part
Feel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart
And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you
A long time ago I had a lady to love
She made me think of things I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song, it was there all the time
So lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow
Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do
Look around, come to me
I have no answers, but know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart
And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you
So lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow
Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, lady I do
They were young
Living for the moment
Hearts on fire
Burning in the night
Hopeless love
Driving them together
I don't know why
Vicious words
Cut them like a razor
Filthy lies
Tearing them apart
So they run
Clinging to each other
Can't get too far
So wrong, so wrong
How could they be
So wrong, so wrong
How could love be so wrong
I don't know why
Late at night
Tryin for the border
Through the police rendezvous
Warning shots
Flyin all around
What can they do
So wrong, so wrong
How could they be
So wrong, so wrong
How could love be so wrong
I don't know why
(repeat)

Hey baby, you know it's true
I'm in love with you
Babe, but you never (
Never gonna be what I want
No, you're never gonna be (Never gonna be what I want)
Yeah, All the shotgun lovers on the avenue
Yes, it's true, he's much too old for you
Babe, but you never (Never gonna be what I want)

Yeah, follow the leader
Follow the leader
And the leader is you

(Hot fun!) Fun in the summertime
There's no better way to spend our time, baby
But that's never (Never really what's it's about)
No, no, no, no, that's never really what it's about
Oh yeah, I know what you're thinking
You could never get me to cheat on you
Babe, but it's never (Never really what's it's about)
Stop making me feel (Never really what's it's about)

Oh, you people know that's true, yeah
So follow the leader
Follow the leader
Just follow the leader
And the leader is you
Yeah, you follow the leader
Follow, follow the leader
And the leader is you, yeah, you

When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

Ooh, ooh, baby
Yes, oh, baby
Yes, oh, baby
Yes, oh, baby

Sandy beach and was making love
As a tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Want to be with you all my life

Ooh, ooh, baby
Yes, oh, baby
Yes, oh, baby
Yes, oh, baby

Dreams of you all the time
Feels so good when we're together, love
Just can't wait until tomorrow night
Hey, baby, let's shake it

Just as I thought, it was goin' alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all

I could leave, but I won't go, though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

But why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Turnin' me on, turnin' me off
Makin' me feel like I want too much
Livin' with you's just a-puttin' me through it all of the time
Runnin' around, stayin' out all night
Takin' it all instead of takin' one bite
Livin' with you's just a-puttin' me through it all of the time

I could leave, but I won't go
, but it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

But why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in tryin' to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end


But I could leave, but I won't go
, it'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So, why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

But I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in tryin' to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end

But just as I thought it was goin' alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Well, I could say day, and you'd say night
You tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all


She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat
tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater


Ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Whoa-oh, here she comes, watch out)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
Ooh, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
The woman is wild, woo
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, watch out, boy, watch out, boy
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
Yeah, yeah, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater)
She's watching and waiting, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, she's a maneater
My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will rise, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight
My love is the miles and the waiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns
And the pain that won't stop
And its fuel is the years leading me on
Leading me down the road
Driving me on, driving me on
Driving me down the road
My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side?
Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back, no
There is no turning back on the run
My love is in league with the freeway
Oh the freeway and the coming of night-time
My love
My love is in league with the freeway

I'm tripping out
I'm tripping out over you, babe - over you, babe
I'm tripping out
I'm tripping out over you babe, over you

Each day I'm not with you, is like a day without sunshine
I'm the whole of you, babe
You've become a part of me - ooh wee
You're not like other girls, or is it my imagination?
This pounding in my heart, girl, is all because of you\
You've got me

Tripping out, tripping out over you, babe
Over you, little mama
I'm tripping out, tripping out over you, babe
Over you, babe

Let me be your slave, because I've learnt to worship you
I'll do anything you say, anything you want me to
To me you are my queen, and I'm your knight in shining armour
Standing guard over your love, the love you've given me
You've got me

Tripping out, tripping out, over you, babe
I'm going crazy for you, mama
I'm tripping out, tripping out, tripping out, over you
Come on

Come on
Come on
It's a good feeling, ain't it, girl?
Come on
All over you, all over you, baby
Come on
Ooh wee, ooh wee, tripping out, tripping out
Come on

Each day I'm not with you, is like a day without sunshine
I'm hung up on your love
You've become a part of me
To me you are my queen, and I'm your knight in shining armour
Standing guard over your love, the love you've given me
You've got me

Tripping out, tripping out, over you, babe
You're so good to me, mama
Tripping out, tripping out, tripping out over you

I love you, baby
You're so good to me, little mama
Ooh wee, it's alright, it's alright
Tripping out
Ooh, trip on, it's alright, it's alright
Little fine pretty thing, tripped me out
She tripped me out
Got me all mixed up for you, baby
Every time I see you, every time I see you
And I hear you say "ooh wee", you trip me out
So sweet, so sweet, tripping me out
So sweet, tripping me out
So sweet, so sweet, so sweet, so sweet
Tripping me out
Tripping out, tripping out
Tripping out, tripping out all night long

One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights


One of these nights
Mmm, in between the dark and the light
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you, baby, one of these nights
One of these nights
Hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo, hoo-hoo
One of these nights
I can feel you
I can feel
One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you, now
One of these nights
And it gets so dark
So dark and cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you
Comin' right behind you, now
One of these nights
Hoo, hoohoooo
One of these nights
And I wanna say, ahhh
One of these nights
One of these, one of these
One of these nights
Comin' right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
One of these nights

I was walking down a one way street
Just a looking for someone to meet
One woman, who was looking for a man
Now I'm hoping (hoping) that the feeling is right
And I'm wondering (wondering) if you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
Oh you're making me believe it too

Now the feeling is beginning to grow
And the meaning is something you only know
If you believe it, take my hand and I'll take your heart
Come on
Now I'm wondering (wondering) where does true love begin
I'm going under (under) so I'm letting you in
My woman (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

(Do you believe in love)
Do you believe in love
(Do you believe it's true)
You believe it's true
(Do you believe in love)
Oh you're making me believe it too

(I used to have you in a photograph)
I'm so glad it's changed
(But now I've got you and it's gonna last)
Do you believe in love

(Do you believe in love)
(Do you believe it's true)
I'm so glad! I'm so glad!
(Do you believe in love)

From so far across the floor, now, baby
That’s nothing new, I’ve watched you
So many times before, now, baby
I see that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And what it’s telling me
And you know, ooh girl, that I’m not shy
I’m glad you picked up on my telepathy, now, baby

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (oh well, oh well)

Every time I get to feelin' this way
I wish I had you near me
I wanna reach out and touch you…

I can’t stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me baby when I’m holding you
I shake and I shiver when I know you’re near
Then you whisper in my ear (oh baby, well, well)

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (oh well, oh well)
I can give you all the lovin’ you need

You read my mind)
Girl, I wanna shake you down
I can give you all the lovin’ you need
Come on, let me take you down
We’ll go all the way to heaven

With a little luck we can help it out
We can make this whole damn thing work out
With a little love we can lay it down
Can't you feel the town exploding?

There is no end to what we can do together (Together)
There is no end (There is no end, there is no end)
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
And if he can do it, we can do it just me and you

And a little luck we can clear it up
We can bring it in for a landing
With a little luck we can turn it on
There can be no misunderstanding

There is no end to what we can do together (Together)
There is no end (There is no end, there is no end)
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
We can do it, just me and you

With a little push we could set it off
We can send it rocketing skywards
With a little love we could shake it up
Don't you feel the comet exploding?

(With a little luck, with a little luck)
(With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck)
(With a little luck, with a little luck)
With a little luck we can help it out
(With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck)
We can make this whole damn thing work out
(With a little luck, with a little luck)
With a little love we can lay it down
(With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck)
Can't you feel the town exploding
(With a little luck, with a little luck)
With a little love, baby
(With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck)
We could set it off, send it rocketing skywards
(With a little luck, with a little luck)
With a little luck we could shake it up, oh yeah, yeah
(With a little luck, a little luck, a little luck)

Woh oh, woo
In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin kind of groovy
I call you up and ask you if you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
First you say no, you've got some plans for the night
And then you stop, and say, all right
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
You always keep me guessin
I never seem to know what you are thinkin
And if a fella looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin
I get confused, cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile, and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky
Spooky
If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin
I'm gonna tell you all what my heart's been a-dyin to be sayin
Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin my dreams
So I'll propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
Spooky, oh yea yea
I said Spooky yea yea
When I told you it was fine to come
I was in for one big surprise
Now I lay awake and count endless hours
Tears are dropping from my eyes
Here's a message for everyone
You must never let her go to far
Yesterday you called my name
Now you're gone and I'm insane
Seems I've made the same mistake again
It's true, I was livin' on a razor's edge
You were leavin' for L.A
Now you know me, I'll go to sleep out there
It's quite alright but I'm going to L.A
Yesterday you called my name
Now you're gone and I'm insane
Seems I've made the same mistake again
Keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive
When I told you it was fine to come
I was in for one surprise
Now I lay awake and count these endless hours
Tears are dropping from my eyes
Here's a message I made for everyone
You must never let her go to far
Cause yesterday you called my name
Now you're gone and I'm insane
I think I made the same mistake again
Keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive
We gotta keep, keep it alive
Yeah keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive, keep it alive

I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late

Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh oh oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone

Do you like me? Circle yes or no
On this piece of paper
'Cause I really really need to know
Are you gonna be my fifth grade queen?
Hand it back after second hour
Then I will know if you're gonna be my special flower
Ooh girl, 'cause I need to know
I will

Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh oh oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone

When you kissed me on the playground
I lost my breath, I had to lay down
And assess what I had seen
Then I had to write the words out
'Cause you took them out of my mouth
But it's hard for me to read
Out loud
Oh gee
Oh gosh

I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late, girl
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say, girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say, girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake, girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late


It was way past midnight
And she still couldn't fall asleep
This night the dream was leavin'
She tried so hard to keep
And with the new day's dawning
She felt it driftin' away
Not only for a cruise
Not only for a day

Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart
[Chorus 2] 
As the day came up she made a start
She stopped waiting another day for
The captain of her heart

Too long ago, too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart
[Verse 1: Robert Lamm, 
Peter Cetera
Both
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs

Eh Cumpari, ci vo sunari
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday
[Verse 2: Robert Lamm, 
Peter Cetera
Both
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think it was the Fourth of July
People talking, really smiling
A man playing guitar
Singing for us all

Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way
Listen children, all is not lost
All is not lost, oh no oh
[Verse 3: Robert Lamm, 
Peter Cetera
Both
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
(Yes it is)
Funny days in the park
Every day's the Fourth of July
People reaching, really touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all

If you want it, really want it
Can you dig it? (Yes, I can)
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day, yeah yeah yeah
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
People on their own are getting nowhere
I'm on the road to see
If anything is anywhere or waiting, just for me
Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
That feeling of being together when I go
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
Hey, everybody, don't you feel that there's something
But you know in a moment it is gone
I live for the day when I can hear people saying
That they know and they care for everyone
But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life
Never knowing home
It's a long way, it's a long, long, long way there
I'm gonna keep on tryin', I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah
I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on tryin'
Been away from home for such a long time
And got to know this town
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around
Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way
Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
Feel it, feel it
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
When I get home, babe
Gonna light your fire
All day I've been thinkin' about you, babe
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I wanna taste your lips
I wanna be your fantasy, yeah
Don't know what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me
Every time I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin' in my arms
And you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
I love you
I need you, yeah
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Stay with me, lay with me, holding me, loving me, baby
Here with me, near with me, feeling you close to me, baby
So show me, show me everything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you
I need you, yeah
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in

See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything's all right

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
And I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waiting there
Not a care in the world

See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Through cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Kissing you was not what I had planned
And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me
You're the only one I can think of
You're the only one I see

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

Yes it's true we've all been hurt before
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're making
Then I don't know what it is

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

No stars are out tonight
But we're shining our own light
And it's never felt so bright
Cause girl the way I'm feeling
It's easy to believe
That you're all I need

Ahhhh
You're all I need
Oooooh ahhhh
Can't find the reason to stay with you
By now a reason should appear
Anybody else could understand my fear
That you're much too much
You're much too much
Much too much, too soon
You're much too much
Too soon
Don't think I'm blown away by what I am
It's just a job, that keeps me traveling
One thing I've learned is how to take my time
And you're much too much
You're much too much
You're much too much
Too soon
You're much too much
Too soon
Don't get too heavy baby
You've only known me for a week
Got to keep it steady baby, steady baby
Ooh, got to keep it real
Anything that I could say
Everything that I've been saying
All comes down to that same old thing
That I love you
But I don't "love" you
I love you
But I don't "love" you
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know you baby, know you baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know you baby, know you baby...
(Repeat to fade)

Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

(Never let another girl like you)
Work me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
(Whoa)
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no (Oh no), I got to keep on moving

Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I got higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark
I give you warnin'

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it

I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
"I can see me a tall, dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned"
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
From behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you (Oh)
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind (Stay away)
Beware the devil woman (Oh)
She's gonna get you (She's gonna get you)
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just...

Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven's holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let's slip off to
A sand dune, real soon
And kick up a little dust

Come on, 
cactus
 is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on, 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

You don't have to answer
There's no need to speak
I'll be your belly dancer, prancer
And you can be my sheik


I know your daddy's a sultan
A nomad known to all
With fifty girls to attend him
They all send him
Jump at his beck and call
But you won't need no harem, honey
When I'm by your side
And you won't need no camel, no no
When I take you for a ride

Come on, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on, 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Got shadows painting our faces
And traces of romance in our heads

Oh come on, oh come on
Woo hoo hoo, yeah, oh yeah
I just can't pretend no more, I keep runnin' out of lies
Lovin' you is killin' me inside
Every time I find the words to end it
Something in your eyes won't let it
Shandi, tonight must last us forever
Forever we say good night and go home
But you know me very well, and I know you
You can't tell me good night (say good night)
We been holding on so tight, we're afraid to let it go
Shake it loose, we both could use the ride
Here's another mess I got myself in
And when you touch me, you ain't helpin'
Shandi, tonight must last us forever
Forever we say good night and go home
But you know me very well, and I know you
You can't tell me good night (say good night)
Say good night when we should say good bye (say good bye)
Mmm yeah
Shandi, tonight must last us forever and ever
Forever we say good night and go home
Shandi, Shandi, tonight must last us forever
Oooohhhh
Oooohhhh
Oooohhhh
Oooohhhh

Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One? (Plug One)
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me, I know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

I know I'll love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak?
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two (Is Plug Two)
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true (True)

I know I'll love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul (Soul)
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing (In full swing)
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause

I know I'll love you better

It's I again, and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we can meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
"Let the wedding begin" (The wedding begin)
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're deaf
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

I know I'll love you better

Love has found its way
In our hearts today (Yeah)
Love has found its way
In our hearts today

When you love is beautiful
There's nothing, nothing that can go wrong
When two hearts beat together
It's like an everlasting song
It's like an everlasting song
The moon shines bright over yonder (Yeah)
And it makes me feel so fine
I'm so thankful, so thankful, baby
That 
Jah
 has made you mine
I'm so thankful that 
Jah
 has made you mine ('Cause)

Love has found its way
In our hearts today (Yeah)
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today (Well)

Oh, baby, please let me stay with you
This love is so hard to resist
Let me feel your loving kindness
And all your tenderness
Oh, lady, you make me so very happy
Even a blind man could see
That love can be so beautiful
Love that's meant to be
Love that's meant to be ('Cause-a)

Love has found its way
In our hearts today (Yeah)
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today (Yeah)

Oh, lady, oh, lady
You bring me up, you bring me up
I'm never, I'm never gonna let you
Slip through my fingers
No way, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, lady, let me stay
Let me stay in your heart
Love is so hard to resist
And most, and most of all, love, love is real

I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha 
&amp; Frida
I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow
[Bridge: Frida 
&amp; Agnetha
And you make me talk 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? 
(Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game

I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited
[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha 
&amp; Frida
Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida 
&amp; Björn
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow
[Bridge: Frida, 
Agnetha &amp; Frida
And you make me talk 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me 
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? 
(Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
Oh, yes, I wanna know
[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida 
&amp; Björn
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)
[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida 
&amp; Björn
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it...
When I was younger, man
I hadn't a care
Fooling around
Hitting the town
Growing my hair
You came along
And stole my heart
When you entered my life
Ooh, babe
You got what it takes
So I made you my wife
Since then
I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, ooh
I love you
You came along
From far away
And found me here
I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile
You said
You're much too young
Your life ain't begun
Let's walk for awhile
And as my head was spinning 'round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, ooh
I want you
Thank you, babe
For being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, ooh
I need you
As my head was coming round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, ooh
I want you
Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life
'Cause, ooh
I need you
Since then I never looked back
It's almost like livin' a dream
Ooh
I got you
If ever a man had it all
It would have to be me
And, ooh
I love you
Oh, spring is here and love is in the air
Overflowing with life and I don't have a care
I'm gonna see you shining like your diamond ring
Every cell in our body is singing
Gimme your love forever
Gimme your love
Gimme your love forever
Oh, oh, gimme your love imme your love
All around I see signs of rebirth
Resurrection, renewal, celebration of life on earth
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow
I love you, I want you, please say you'll
Gimme your love forever
Gimme your love
Gimme your love forever
Oh, oh, gimme your love imme your love
People think I'm crazy as I walk along the street
I don't understand 'em anyway
All I know is since you came my life has been so sweet
And that's the way I know it's gonna stay
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow
I love you, I want you, please stay you'll
Gimme your love forever
Gimme your love
Gimme your love forever
Oh, oh, gimme your love imme your love

Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut, drowning it in pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ahh-ahh

Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
La-la-la, la-la
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I could feel at the time
There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night
Who can say where they're blowing?
As free as the wind
Hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

More than this
You know there's nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
Ooh, there's nothing

It was fun for a while
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night
Who can say where we're going?
No care in the world
Maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

More than this
You know there's nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
No, there's nothing
More than this
Nothing
More than this
More than this
Nothing
Jane be Jane
You're better that way
Not when you're trying
Imitating something you think you saw
Jane be Jane
And if sometimes that might
Drive them away
Let them stay there
You don't need them anyway
You're worried there might not be
Anything at all inside
But that you're worried
Should tell you that's not right
Don't try to see yourself
The way that others do
It's no use
You're worried there might not be
Anything at all inside
But that you're worried
Should tell you that's not right
You've had it harder than anyone could know
So hard to let it go
But it's your life
And you can decorate it
As you like
Beneath the paint and armour
In your eyes the truth still shines
Jane be Jane
Jane be Jane

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat

Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me
Like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me
Safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place
To harbor you and me
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat

Up to now
We sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips
To keep me warm
Oh, I need to have the strength
That flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear
When love can see me through
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat
Rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat
Rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat

Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)


Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere...)

Been away, haven't seen you in a while
How've you been, have you changed your style?
And do you think that we've grown up differently?
Don't seem the same, seems you've lost your feel for me

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho

I'm going back to a place that's far away
How bout you, 
have you got a place to stay?
Why should I care
 when I'm just trying to get along?
We were friends, but now it's the end of our love song

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooh-hoo-hoo, oh, oh-oh-ho
Hit it!
It was thirty days around the horn
The captain says it's a thirty-five more
The moon looks mean and the crew ain't staying
"There's gonna be some blood" is what they're all saying
It's a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
And I was just another fool (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
There ain't no easy way out (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
They're gonna shake you 'til you shout, hey, hey (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
They treat you like a dog, but you're only human
You miss your home, Lord, you miss that woman
The captain laughs, he says, "You boys want some sex?
You can squeeze the sails, you can lick the decks"
It was a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I guess I just was born to lose (Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
They tell you life is going cheap (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I got myself in pretty deep (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
(Starlight lost in the night)
(Drift away and it feels all right) And it feels all right
(Starlight alone in the night)
(Drift away and it feels all right) And it feels all right
I guess it feels all right
The fever's hot, the winds are blowin' cold
The captain's crazy eye puts the fear in your soul
I heard somebody cryin', "Lord, let this end
You know I'll never go to sea again"
It was a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
And now we're sendin' out the news (Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
There ain't no victory at sea (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
Unless it's mutiny (Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)
Now if I don't get off alive, it's just as well
I'll be waking up in heaven, 'cause I've been through hell
On this shakedown cruise
They call it a shakedown cruise
Aw, shake me down, boy
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
(Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
It was a shakedown cruise
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
It got me shakin' in my shoes
(Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)
And now I'm feelin' kinda blue
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
Whoo!
(Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
Shakedown cruise
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I said, shake me down, boys
(Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)
Whoo!
(Shakedown, shakedown cruise)

Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you’re the best

I wasn’t looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why d’you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There’s some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it comin’
How’d you learn to do the things you do?

Oh, and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darlin’ you’re the best
Baby you're the best
Darlin', you're the best
Baby you're the best

When my mama met my girl, she took me aside
She's a soft-spoken woman, but she speaks her mind
She said, "De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Let nothing come between you
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Don't let nothing come between you"
I went to see my friend to ask his advice
He just smiled and, "She's good around the eyes"
But I'd already made up my mind
Let nothing come between us

There are frustrated people in town
Who might envy us and wanna bring us down
We know they don't really mean any harm
But that doesn't mean we've gotta let 'em hang around

Got the license, got the ring
Got back the blood tests and everything
Puttin' on my boutonniere, it's her favorite flower
And I'm walking down the altar and I'm gonna take the vow
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Don't let nothing come between us, yeah
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Don't let nothing come between us

There are frustrated people in town
Who might envy us and wanna bring us down
We know they don't really mean us any harm
But that doesn't mean we've gotta let 'em hang around

De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Don't let nothing come between us, I said
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Don't let nothing come between us

I have advice for the young and old
If I may be so bold
When you find someone to have and hold
Don't let nothing come between you, hey
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Get together and let nothing come between you
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Get together and let nothing come between you (Do-do-do, do-do-do)
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Get together and let nothing come between you
De-de-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de
Get together and let nothing come between you
When it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone
The days get rainy and the nights get long
When you get that feelin' you were born to lose
Staring at your ceiling thinkin' of your blues
When there's so much trouble that you wanna cry
The world has crumbled and you don't know why
When your hopes are fading and they can't be found
Dreams have left you waiting, friends have let you down
Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Maybe then your blues will fade away
When you need a lover and you're down so low
Start to wonder, but you never know
When it feels like sorrow is your only friend
Knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again
When the blues come callin' at the break of dawn
Rain keeps fallin', but the rainbow's gone
When you feel like crying but the tears won't come
When your dreams are dyin', when you're on the run
Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
The woman she like to Rumba
The woman she like Calypso
The steel drums drive her crazy
And she can't seem to say no
She just can't seem to resist them, no
She's been drinking Jamaican rum
Dancing to the steel drums from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
It's that West Indian rhythm
It was wild, it was wild
The night she came home drunk
She kicked in the door
And said lover you know what I want
Lover, give me what I want
She's been drinking Jamaican rum
And she's living with a black man
He's from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
She's been drinking Jamaican rum
Dancing to the steel drums from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
Rum and cola
It's very popular and it's twice as nice with ice

If I could turn the page
In time
then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Close my eyes
And I see your face at night
Tossin', turnin'
Fall to sleep holding my pillow tight

All the time, I think of you
You're with me, no matter what I do

Walk around
With a smile upon my face
In my mind
You have taken up permanent space

Now my life is filled with nothing less
Than your sweet love, care, and tenderness

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Call my name
And I lose all self-control
Touch my hand
And I feel it deep down in my soul

I am feeling what I can't explain
And if what you're feeling is the same

Let's get serious, ooh!
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

S.E.R.I.O.U.S
Baby, let's get serious
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

In your arms
Is the place I wanna be
With my love
In you, and your love inside of me

Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we've got so much we want to share

Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious

Aow!

Ooh!

Night is young
But not quite too young for you and me
Let's be one, be one!
Going places that we want to see

Let our bodies travel with our minds
To a place where love will always shine

Let's get serious, ooh!
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious

Both of us feel like exploding (Serious)
'Cause this stuff's too hot for holding (Serious)
Let's get serious and fall in love
Girl, you've got my body moaning (Serious)
Just believe it's made for cloning (Serious)
Let's get serious and fall in love
Serious, ooh!
Serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
It's early in the morning
Today I'm moving away
Sittin' here for the last time
Makes me feel so strange
My life here has ended
Like a pulled up weed
Don't play no sad songs
They'll make me cry
This situation reminds me
Of when I went away to school
My friends they all called me
And said I've been made a fool
My boyfriend he left me
For my best friend
Ahh don't play no sad songs
They'll make me cry
'Cause sad songs are tearin' up my heart again
Loneliness is standing in my path again
I can feel it comin'
I can hear it callin' out my name
I don't wanna remember
What I'm leavin' behind
The radio plays a sad song
And brings it on
Loneliness surrounds me
Like clouds bring rain
Ahh don't play no sad songs
They'll make me cry
'Cause sad songs are tearin' up my heart again
Loneliness is standing in my path again
I can feel it comin'
I can hear it callin' out my name

Flying me back to Memphis
Gotta find my Daisy Jane
Well the summer's gone
And I hope she's feeling the same
Well I left her just to roam the city
Thinking it would ease the pain
I'm a crazy man
And I'm playing my crazy game, game

Does she really love me? I think she does
Like the stars above me, I know because
When the sky is bright
Everything's alright

Flying me back to Memphis
Honey, keep the oven warm
All the clouds are clearing
And I think we're over the storm
Well I've been picking it up around me
Daisy I think I'm sane
But I'm awful glad
And I guess you're really to blame, blame

Do you really love me? I hope you do
Like the stars above me, how I love you
When it's cold at night
Everything's alright


The song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you've got till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance
Listenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air until they play the last song
I'll do my time
Oh, keeping you off my mind but there's moments
That I find, I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Ah, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Runnin' down by the lakeshore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again...whoa, again


The boat's steaming in
Oh, I watch the sidewheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
Oh, I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Ah, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
As she turns to go
Listen to the...listen to the mandolin rain

Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Ooohhh
Listen to the mandolin rain

Seventy-three men sailed up from the San Francisco Bay
Rolled off of their ship, and here's what they had to say
"We're callin' everyone to ride along to another shore
We can laugh our lives away and be free once more"
But no one heard them callin', no one came at all
Cause they were too busy watchin' those old raindrops fall
As a storm was blowin' out on the peaceful sea
Seventy-three men sailed off to history
Ride, captain ride upon your mystery ship
Be amazed at the friends you have here on your trip
Ride captain ride upon your mystery ship
On your way to a world that others might have missed

My love and I, we work well together
But often we're apart
Absence makes the heart lose weight
, yeah
Till love breaks down, love breaks down
Oh my, oh my, have you seen the weather
The sweet September rain
Rain on me like no other
Until I drown, until I drown
When love breaks down
The things you do
To stop the truth from hurting you
When love breaks down
The lies we tell
They only serve to fool ourselves
When love breaks down
The things you do
To stop the truth from hurting you
When love breaks down
When love breaks down
My love and I, we are boxing clever
She'll never crowd me out
Fall be free as old confetti
And paint the town, paint the town
When love breaks down
The things you do
To stop the truth from hurting you
When love breaks down
The lies we tell
They only serve to fool ourselves
When love breaks down
The things you do
To stop the truth from hurting you
When love breaks down
The lies we tell
They only serve to fool ourselves
When love breaks down
The things you do
To stop the truth from hurting you
When love breaks down
You join the wrecks
Who leave their hearts for easy sex
When love breaks down
When love breaks down

Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see?
The music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

Fantasy
Could never be so killing
I feel free
I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up and kick your feet up
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes and love is all around us
I can take you where you want to go
Oh, oh

Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see?
The music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes and love is all around us
I can take you where you want to go
Oh, oh

Dance with me
I want to be your partner
Can't you see?
The music is just starting
Night is calling and I am falling
Dance with me

Taking a foreign flight
Looking for signs of life
When you flashed upon my screen
Testing the atmosphere
Your silhouette appears
And I know I'm not alone

But empty haze
Is all that remains
I'm lost on the sidewalk
Just calling your name

I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway

I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway

Live via satellite
Checking my vital signs
Because it all feels so unreal
Everything good must end
But we can live again
In the glass 
simulacra

I can't replace
Your ethereal waves
I sleep on the concrete
And dream of days

I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away

I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway

I'm lyin' alone with my head on the phone
Thinkin' of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too, but
What else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long, lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

Oh, what are you thinkin' of?
What are you thinkin' of?
What are you thinkin' of?
What are you thinkin' of?

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

(I'm all out of love)
(I'm so lost without you)
(I know you were right)
She gets an hour for lunch but if it comes to the crunch
She can stretch it if you know what I mean
She meets him at a hotel where they're not known very well
'Cause they never stay beyond 2:15
She does her make-up with care and runs a brush through her hair
Then grabs a cab back up to Third Avenue
And at a quarter to three, her friends say "Oh-my-oh-me
Whatever you just had for lunch agrees with you"
Lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour
How do you find time to eat?
Well, there are so many people on the street
All of them are hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry
Lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour
Gimme a sandwich to go
Well, as long as I can see you, I know
I'll never go hungry
He takes a drive every day
From Brooklyn to JFK
Because he meets a flight at noon from Montreal
And every day he'll await
Outside Air Canada's gate
'Cause she's a stewardess connecting with St. Paul
And when his lady arrives
They run for both of their lives
Out to the Piper Cub Motel that they call home
Then back to Terminal 2
She meets her husband anew
He is the navigator of a flight from Rome
And it's lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour
How do you find time to eat?
Well, there are so many people on the street
And all of them are hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry
Lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour
Gimme a sandwich to go
Well, as long as I can see you, I know
I'll never go hungry
No lunch, no brunch
I'll munch something on the run, dear
East side, west side
Fast ride, lunch hour's begun here
I'm on a diet (No lunch, no brunch)
You might try it
(I'll munch something on the run, dear) Fast food and hot love
(East side, west side) You can do it
Long as you got love (Fast ride, lunch hour's begun here)
We live on a nine-hour day (No lunch, no brunch)
We sleep 8 hours away
(I'll munch something on the run, dear)
Work from 9 to 5 with 60 minutes off
(East side, west side) So when lunch hour's begun
We're really ready to run
(Fast ride, lunch hour's begun here)
It's on your mark, it's down and set, it's off
(No lunch, no brunch) Off to a table for two
Off to a room with a view
(I'll munch something on the run, dear)
With someone new who you just barely know
(East side, west side) You're really up for the date
And you don't want to be late
But still you swear your watch is 60 minutes slow
Is it lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour?
How do you find time to eat?
Well, there are so many people on the street
And all of them are hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry
Lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour, lunch hour
Gimme a sandwich to go
Well, as long as I can see you, I know
I'll never go hungry
These are the eyes
That never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life (do-do-do-do-do)
And these are the arms
That long to lock you inside every day
And every night
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Girl, and here is the soul of
Which you've taken control
Can'tcha see I'm tryin' to show love is right
Whoa, oh, oh, oh show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you"
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby
These are the hands
That can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere in sight
(Anywhere in sight)
And these are the lips
That can't help callin' your name
In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
Whoa
And here is the man
Who needs to know where you stand
Dontcha know I've done all I can
So decide
Whoa, oh, oh, oh show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "I love you" (I love you)
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby, baby, baby
Ahh, here is the soul
Of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm tryin' to show love is right
Ooh, girl, show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "Oh, I love you"
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Show and tell
Just a game I play
When I wanna say "Oh, I love you"
Girl, so show me and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby, baby

I was walkin' down the street
Concentrating on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

I say
I don't like cricket, oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket, no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be joking man
It was a present from me mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home

And I say
I don't like reggae, no no
I love it
I don't like reggae
I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' piña colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder?
She said I've got it, you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it, you'll like it
And wallow in a dreadlock holiday
(Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday
Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday)

And I say
Don't like Jamaica, oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica, oh no
I love her (Oh yeah)
Don't you walk through her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet

I don't like cricket (Oh no)
I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like reggae (Oh no)
I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
Don't like Jamaica (Hey)
I love her (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like cricket

Walks like a lady
With her tender charms
She moves like a lady
When I'm in her arms
She loves like a lady
Loving all night long
She cries like a baby
When she's done something wrong

I told you once, yes, I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
I catch you walking with that boy again
I'm gonna set you free
Oh, I'm gonna set you free

Loves like a lady
So soft and slow
She feels like a lady
Ooo, I can't let go
She smiles like a lady
Smiling all night long
But cries lake a baby
When she's done something wrong

I told you once, yes, I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
I catch you walking with that boy again
I'm gonna set you free
Oh, I'm gonna set you free

Walks like a lady
Oh, but she cries like a little girl
Walks like a lady
Yes, but she cries like a little girl
Walks like a lady
Walks like a lady
Cries like a little girl
On the run
I'm riding the night
Out from the hangman's rope
On the run
I believe I'm heading for New Mexico
It's just the way I'm going, going down
See the horse I'm riding, that's my home
With the wind behind my back
And the gold that's in my pack
We'll be riding til we're dead
Til we're dead
On the run
Looking over my shoulder
For the lawman's gun
On the run
And my body's burning from the blazing sun
Yes the way I'm going, going down
See the horse I'm riding, that's my home
With the wind behind my back
And the gold that's in my pack
We'll be riding til we're dead
Til we're dead
That's just the way I'm going, going down
See the horse I'm riding, that's my home
With the wind behind my back
And the gold that's in my pack
We'll be riding til we're dead
Til we're dead, til we're dead
Til we're dead, til we're dead
Til we're dead, til we're dead
Everyone's talking
You're back in the news again
You're out on the line now
I'm on the other end
Well, I'm driving at night
With the rain and the lights on my window
And the radio's on
And there comes that song
The one that makes you feel so lonely
Love is cold
Ooh, ooh
Love is cold
People in motion
Everything stays the same
Somebody's leaving
Somebody still remains
Well, you're out on the street
Where the happy people meet in the evening
And you're hurrying on
But you still hear that song
The one that makes you feel so lonely
Love is cold
Yes, I know
Love is cold
Well, I think that it's time to go
Love is cold
And now you feel so lost and lonely
Love is cold
Well, it's cold
Love is cold
And still, you want to hold her
Love is cold
He was a searcher
She was the only one
Nobody told them
Everything comes undone


So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture-show
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

Cause you're the joke of the neighbourhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

There are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery
Is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar
She used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home

You never see what you wanna see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

And when you're up on the stage it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable
How they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity
Is there no way out?
Oh yeah!


Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be
For you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you would had more time

So when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home

You took the long way home
Do it again
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Oh yah!
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Ooh, yeah
You took the long way home

Aah aah aah aah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Aah aah aah aah

Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home

Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Ooh, oh


It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

In an illusion I saw you last night
You were dancing under misty starlight
A hundred angels sang from out of the blue
And I was standing there just looking at you
I can't explain the way it made me feel
So unbelievable and yet so real
And as you danced the night was turning to day
I reached to touch you, but you faded away

Is it a dream?
Am I a dreamer?
Did I really see you?
Is it a dream?
Is it a dream?
Did I really see you?
Is it a dream?
Is it a dream?
I've got the feeling that I'm
Floating away on the ebb of the tide
No good running away 'cause there's nowhere to hide
I've given it all and it don't mean a thing without you

Are you real or did my eyes deceive?
Do you exist or are you make believe?
I'm gonna search for you all over the world
I've got to know if you're a real-live girl
If I don't find you, I know what I'll do
I'll go on dreaming until you come true
I've got to have you, such a beautiful sight
I just can't wait to dream about you tonight

Is it a dream?
Am I a dreamer?
Did I really see you?
Is it a dream?
Is it a dream?
Did I really see you?
Is it a dream?
Is it a dream?
I've got the feeling that I'm
Floating away on the ebb of the tide
No good running away 'cause there's nowhere to hide
I've given it all and it don't mean a thing without you

It's another chain around my heart
I dream of you and then the feeling starts
I've given it all
And it don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
It don't mean a thing without you
Well, I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night
I love to hear the thunder
Watch the lightning
When it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good
Well, I love a rainy night
It's such a beautiful sight
I love to feel the rain
On my face
Taste the rain on my lips
In the moonlight shadow
Showers washed
All my cares away
I wake up to a sunny day
'Cause I love a rainy night
Yeah, I love a rainy night
Well, I love a rainy night
Well, I love a rainy night
Ooh-ooh
I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night
I love to hear the thunder
Watch the lightning
When it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good
Well, I love a rainy night
It's such a beautiful sight
I love to feel the rain
On my face
To taste the rain on my lips
In the moonlight shadows
Puts a song
In this heart of mine
Puts a smile on my face every time
'Cause I love a rainy night
Yeah, I love a rainy night
Ooh, I love a rainy night
Yeah, I love a rainy night
Ooh-ooh

Showers washed
All my cares away
I wake up to a sunny day
'Cause I love a rainy night
Yeah, I love a rainy night
Well, I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night
Well, I love a rainy night
You can see it in my eyes
Yeah, I love a rainy night
Well, it makes me high
Ooh, I love a rainy night
You know I do, yeah, yeah
I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night
You can see it in my eyes..

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun shiny day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun shiny day

I think I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright (Bright), bright sun shiny day

Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies

I can see clearly now; the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun shiny day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun shiny day
I've spent all summer days driving
I'm tired of holidays ruined
No more take-away's, expired food
I need a real day
Time runs faster when you're loaded
Bright lights blind me all weak
Living in the city, I'm a high-speed drill
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food
Roosters from the sister islands too
I'd better get working
I'm bored with all that brainwashing
Let's break all separate rooms
Changing's no fun if you don't want to
I need a good day sailing
To tell the sun and the moon
That I am turning for no reasons too
And I keep waiting
Driving to the gas station
Caught by a traffic jam blues
Life is nonsense, I don't have a clue
I need a cool day riding
Feeding all the horses at dawn
Searching for the truffles
, going through the woods
Then I'll be waiting
I've spent all summer days driving
I'm tired of holidays ruined
No more take-away's, expired food
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food
Roosters from the sister islands too
I'd better get working

I saw her leave the luau
With the one who parked the cars
And the fat one from the swimming pool
They were swayin' arm in arm

I can hear the ukuleles playing
Down by the sea
She's gone with the hula hula boys
She don't care about me
She's gone with the hula hula boys
And she don't care about me
They're singing

Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana


Yesterday she went to see the Polynesian band
But she came home with her hair all wet
And her clothes all filled with sand
I didn't have to come to Maui
To be treated like a jerk
How do you think I feel
When I see the bellboys smirk?

And I can hear the ukuleles playing
Down by the sea
She's gone with the hula hula boys
She don't care about me
They're singing

Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Ha'ina 'ia mai ana ka puana
Aaah

You set my lips on fire
You won the key to my heart
You've got a special way to move me
Can't stop now
Let's do it again
You keep me dancing through the moonlight
I feel the pleasure in your touch
And everything you are is heaven
Oh I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

Instant replay
Got to have it
Instant replay
Ooh, whoa, ooh-ooh
Instant replay
Got to have your love again

I feel so good about us
I found a shining star
And when I look into your eyes
It's magic
Well, I just know this can't be a dream
I'm so happy must be real
In every way its getting stronger
Now you know it
Let me show it

Instant replay
Oh, got to have it now

Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running, hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin'
 and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
All day long I just sit around the house
And watch the world go by, my oh my
Since I lost her, nothing moves me
Though I try, I don't know why
L.A. weather hot and hazy
Maybe that's what's got me crazy
I wish those dusty Santa Ana winds
Could come and carry me
Out to sea
Just like hot flashes, Santa Anas
Come and rescue me
From her memory
I want to let my feelings go
I want to feel that jetstream blow
When the sun goes down crawl out of bed
Say I'll be all right, tonight's my night
Walk past that picture, see her face
And I change my mind, happens every time
I don't know why I can't get started
I was fine til she departed
I wish those dusty Santa Ana winds
Could come and carry me
Out to sea
Just like hot flashes, Santa Anas
Come and rescue me
From her memory
I want to let my feelings go
Let me feel that jetstream blow
I want to let my feelings go
Want to feel that jetstream blow

We've had some fun
Yes, we've had our ups and downs
Been down that rocky road
But here we are still around
We thought about someone else
But neither one took the bait
We thought about breaking up
Now we know it's much too late

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

(Ooh) Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh) Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh) 'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me


(ooh, wa-ooh)
We've had our doubts
We never took them seriously
(ooh, wa-ooh)
And we've had our ins and outs
But that's the way it's s'posed to be
We thought about giving up (giving up)
But we could never stay away
We thought about breaking up (ooh, wa ooh)
But now we know it's much too late

And it's no great mystery (Ooh)
If we change our minds
Eventually
It's back to you and me

(Ooh) Yes, it's true (yes, it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh) Yes, it's true (yes, it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
(Ooh) 'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me


We are bound by all the rest

I'm so happy to be stuck with you

That you're happy to be stuck with me

If you want me to
If you want me to
Oh, if you want me to
If you want me to
If you want me to

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot
 and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la


After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "when it's right, it's right"
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Like nibbling a little afternoon delight

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun gone down

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Chewing on a piece of grass
Walking down the road
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here, Joe?
Some people say this town don't look good in snow
You don't care, I know

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go
I know-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
'Cause the free wind is blowing through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Did di di di dit, did di di di dit
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit

Wishing on a falling star
Waiting for the early train
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by purple rain
Aw, come on, Joe, you can always
Change your name
Thanks a lot, son, just the same

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer
The nights are stronger than moonshine
You're gonna go
I know-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
'Cause the free wind is blowing through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

Did di di di dit, did di di di dit (du du du du)
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit (du du du du)
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit (du du du du)
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit (du du du du)
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit (du du du du)
Did di di di dit, did di di di dit (du du du du)
You don't know how much I love you
But I love you like the sun
I'd like to put my arms around you
And run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
If you knew how much I miss you
I miss you more each day
I'd really like to come and see you
We could run, run, run, run away
Run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
Summer's comin' and it's getting warmer
Tell me spring is just around the corner
I'm sitting watchin' all the flowers
Birds are singin' getting louder and louder
Here I am, missin' you
Here I go, I'm lovin' you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm wanting you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm needing you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm loving you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', run, run, run, run, run away
If you knew how much I need you
Oh and I need you like the air
If someone should take you from me
I would run, run, run, run away
I'd run, run, run, run away
Let's run, run, run, run away
Summer's comin' and it's getting warmer
Tell me spring is just around the corner
I'm sitting watchin' all the flowers
Birds are singin' getting louder and louder
Here I am, missin' you
Here I go, I'm lovin' you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm wanting you
Run, run, run, run, runnin', here I go I'm needing you

We could run, run, run, run away
Come on, baby, let's run, run, run, run away
Come on, baby, let's run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I want you, run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I need you, run, run, run, run away
You don't know how much I love you, run, run, run, run away

Really like to come and see you,  run, run, run, run away
Really put my arms around you,  run, run, run, run away
One more time, just one more time now,  run, run, run, run away

Can I tell you what you mean to me?
You're as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that you're mine
You're like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes, you are

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

One in a million, oh, so rare
A nightingale in Berkeley Square
And baby, I ain't goin' nowhere without you
You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
You're like rock and roll and champagne
All in one

Something you've got is something I need right now
Let's not mess around anymore
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?
What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

I'll be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time
The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you
I'm complete

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

I'm like a schoolboy in your hands
I wanna get up and sing and dance
You see one hell of a happy man standing here
Individually quite unique
You really swept me off my feet
And baby, you look, oh, so neat
With nothing on

I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, 
to carry on

A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said

They said: Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, babe
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me


I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship, we headed for the skies

Singing come sail away, come sail away, come sail with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walking away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet, I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walking away


When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
, a
nd she said
"We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"

When I was young / I'm talkin' bout the Good times
Just you and me was all we ever cared about
We had it all (we had it all) OH!
I'm talkin' bout the good times – times
Drinkin' all day / Drinkin' all night
Dancin' by the Fire light – C'mon!
CHORUS
Because you are HOT AS HELL!
You know that You are BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN!!
Don't you know that you are SUMMERTIME!!!!!!
YOU'RE ALL THAT I NEED
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!
I'm talkin' bout the simple times – TIMES
Hey, answer the call / No right No wrong
Repeat – Repeat the lines from our favourite songs
Make our way up to Prospect Park!
I'm talkin' bout the good times – times
No reason to fight cause family is tight
And everything is alright
CHORUS
Because you are HOT AS HELL!
You know that You are BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN!!
Don't you know that you are SUMMERTIME!!!!!!
YOU'RE ALL THAT I NEED
BRIDGE
I've been thinkin' about you now
Since you've gone I've been down and out
Iced cold since you left town
You're my SUMMERTIME
Ooo ooo ooo
You are
Ooo ooo ooo
Cause You are
Ooo ooo ooo
Don't you know that you are?!
Ooo ooo ooo
My SUMMERTIME
HOT AS HELL!
BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN!!
Don't you know that you are SUMMERTIME!!!!!!
YOU'RE ALL THAT I NEED

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
We'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
